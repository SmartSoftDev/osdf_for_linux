If you obtained Asterisk under the GPL, then the GPL\n applies to all loadable Asterisk modules used on your system as well,\n except as defined below. The GPL (version 2) is included in this\n source tree in the file COPYING.\n .\n This package also includes various components that are not part of\n Asterisk itself; these components are in the 'contrib' directory\n and its subdirectories. These components are also distributed under the\n GPL version 2 as well.\n .\n Digium, Inc. (formerly Linux Support Services) holds copyright\n and/or sufficient licenses to all components of the Asterisk\n package, and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability\n for companies, individuals, or organizations to create proprietary or\n Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may be dynamically linked at\n runtime with the portions of Asterisk which fall under our\n copyright/license umbrella, or are distributed under more flexible\n licenses than GPL.\n .\n If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry --\n there is no requirement that you provide the same exception in your\n GPL'd products (although if you've written a module for Asterisk we\n would strongly encourage you to make the same exception that we do).\n .\n Specific permission is also granted to link Asterisk with OpenSSL, OpenH323\n and/or the UW IMAP Toolkit and distribute the resulting binary files.\n .\n In addition, Asterisk implements two management/control protocols: the\n Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and the Asterisk Gateway Interface\n (AGI). It is our belief that applications using these protocols to\n manage or control an Asterisk instance do not have to be licensed\n under the GPL or a compatible license, as we believe these protocols\n do not create a 'derivative work' as referred to in the GPL. However,\n should any court or other judiciary body find that these protocols do\n fall under the terms of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a license to\n use these protocols in combination with Asterisk in external\n applications licensed under any license you wish.\n .\n The 'Asterisk' name and logos are trademarks owned by Digium, Inc.,\n and use of them is subject to our trademark licensing policies. If you\n wish to use these trademarks for purposes other than simple\n redistribution of Asterisk source code obtained from Digium, you\n should contact our licensing department to determine the necessary\n steps you must take.

A work that constitutes a\n Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined\n below) for the purposes of this License.\n .\n b. \"Creative Commons Compatible License\" means a license that is\n listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been\n approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this\n License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains\n terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License\n Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing\n of derivatives of works made available under that license under this\n License or either a Creative Commons unported license or a Creative\n Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this\n License.\n .\n c. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work\n and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical\n arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,\n sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any\n other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,\n except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be\n considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the\n avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound\n recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a\n moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the\n purpose of this License.\n .\n d. \"License Elements\" means the following high-level license\n attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this\n License: Attribution, ShareAlike.\n .\n e. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities\n that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\n .\n f. \"Original Author\" means the individual, individuals, entity or\n entities who created the Work.\n .\n g. \"Work\" means the copyrighted voice prompt files recorded by Allison\n Smith for Asterisk and distributed with this License.\n .\n h. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\n License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with\n respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the\n Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous\n violation.\n .\n 2. Fair Use Rights.\n .\n Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any\n rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the\n exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other\n applicable laws.\n .\n 3. License Grant.\n .\n Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby\n grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for\n the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the\n rights in the Work as stated below:\n .\n a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n Collective Works;\n .\n b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such\n Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes\n reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify\n that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a\n translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from\n English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original\n work has been modified.\";\n .\n c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform\n publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio\n transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n .\n d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform\n publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio\n transmission Derivative Works.\n .\n e.

Licensor waives the\n  exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music\n  rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties\n  for any phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and\n  distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC\n  Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other\n  jurisdictions).\n .\n f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of\n doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the\n exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a\n performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the\n public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the\n compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright\n Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n .\n The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\n known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\n such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights\n in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by\n Licensor are hereby reserved.\n .\n 4. Restrictions.\n .\n The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to\n and limited by the following restrictions:\n .\n a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and\n You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,\n this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You\n distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally\n perform.

When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,\n or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any\n technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a\n recipient of the Work from You to exercise of the rights granted to\n that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)\n applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this\n does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be\n made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective\n Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by\n Section 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon\n notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove\n from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as\n requested.\n .\n b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n digitally perform a Derivative Work only under: (i) the terms of this\n License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License\n Elements as this License; (iii) either the Creative Commons (Unported)\n license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a\n later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this\n License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (Unported)); (iv) a Creative\n Commons Compatible License. If you license the Derivative Work under\n one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms\n of that license. If you license the Derivative Work under the terms of\n any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable\n License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License\n generally and with the following provisions: (I) You must include a\n copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, the Applicable\n License with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You\n distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally\n perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative\n Works that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability\n of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\n recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must\n keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to\n the disclaimer of warranties; and, (IV) when You distribute, publicly\n display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You\n may not impose any technological measures on the Derivative Work that\n restrict the ability of a recipient of the Derivative Work from You to\n exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the\n Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Derivative Work\n as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the\n Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made\n subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n .\n c. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any\n Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works\n (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been\n made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for\n the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are\n utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if\n applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or\n Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,\n publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in\n Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable\n means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if\n supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource\n Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the\n Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or\n licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b)\n in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the\n Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by\n Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented\n in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a\n Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will\n appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative\n Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in\n a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other\n contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the\n credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the\n manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n Parties.\n .\n 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer.\n .\n UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,\n LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS\n HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO\n REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,\n EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY,\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\n LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF\n ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\n THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY\n TO YOU.\n .\n 6. Limitation on Liability.\n .\n EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL\n LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\n INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT\n OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n .\n 7. Termination.\n .\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this\n License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or\n Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have\n their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain\n in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8\n will survive any termination of this License.\n .\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\n is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the\n Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to\n release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing\n the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will\n not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has\n been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),\n and this License will continue in full force and effect unless\n terminated as stated above.\n .\n 8. Miscellaneous.\n .\n a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as\n defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in\n Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to\n the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to\n You under this License.\n .\n b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative\n Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work\n on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under\n this License.\n .\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\n by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\n enforceable.\n .\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\n and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n .\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\n with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.",

THE WORK IS\n    PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE\n    WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW\n    IS PROHIBITED.\n .\n    BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND\n    AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS\n    LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU\n    THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF\n    SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n .\n    1. Definitions a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or\n     upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,\n     adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other\n     alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or\n     performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other\n     form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted\n     including in any form recognizably derived from the original,\n     except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be\n     considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the\n     avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance\n     or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation\n     with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation\n     for the purpose of this License.  b. \"Collection\" means a\n     collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias\n     and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or\n     other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section\n     1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of\n     their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the\n     Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one\n     or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\n     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into\n     a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not\n     be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of\n     this License.  c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the\n     public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as\n     appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n     d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or\n     entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n     e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic\n     work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created\n     the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the\n     publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the\n     actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,\n     sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform\n     literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the\n     case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity\n     who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,\n     (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits\n     the broadcast.  f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work\n     offered under the terms of this License including without\n     limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic\n     domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression\n     including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other\n     writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same\n     nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work\n     or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or\n     without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated\n     works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work\n     of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or\n     lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works\n     expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied\n     art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work\n     relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a\n     performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to\n     the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work\n     performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not\n     otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.  g. \"You\" means\n     an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who\n     has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect\n     to the Work, or who has received express permission from the\n     Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous\n     violation.  h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public\n     recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those\n     public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or\n     wireless means or public digital performances; to make available\n     to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may\n     access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen\n     by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process\n     and the communication to the public of the performances of the\n     Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and\n     rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or\n     images.  i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any\n     means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings\n     and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work,\n     including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in\n     digital form or other electronic medium.\n .\n    2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to\n    reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights\n    arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in\n    connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or\n    other applicable laws.\n .\n    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this\n    License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n    non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable\n    copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated\n    below: a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one\n    or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in\n    the Collections; b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided\n    that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,\n    takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise\n    identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example,\n    a translation could be marked \"The original work was translated\n    from English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The\n    original work has been modified.\"; c. to Distribute and Publicly\n    Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,\n    d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.  e. For the\n    avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In\n    those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through\n    any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the\n    Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for\n    any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n    which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n    compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\n    exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n    of the rights granted under this License; and, iii. Voluntary\n    License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\n    royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor\n    is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary\n    licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of\n    the rights granted under this License.\n .\n    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether\n    now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right\n    to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise\n    the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all\n    rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n .\n    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is\n    expressly made subject to and limited by the following\n    restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work\n    only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of,\n    or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with\n    every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may\n    not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms\n    of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to\n    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of\n    the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact\n    all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n    warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may\n    not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that\n    restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to\n    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of\n    the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated\n    in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart\n    from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor\n    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any\n    credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an\n    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\n    Section 4(b), as requested.  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly\n    Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must,\n    unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep\n    intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable\n    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the\n    Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or\n    if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or\n    parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n    attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice,\n    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such\n    party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to\n    the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the\n    Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an\n    Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the\n    Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original\n    Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n    Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be\n    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in\n    the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit\n    will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the\n    Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and\n    in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other\n    contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use\n    the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\n    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under\n    this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply\n    any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original\n    Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You\n    or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior\n    written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or\n    Attribution Parties.  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by\n    the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if\n    You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by\n    itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not\n    distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in\n    relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original\n    Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those\n    jurisdictions (e.g.  Japan), in which any exercise of the right\n    granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make\n    Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\n    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\n    Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not\n    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent\n    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to\n    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License\n    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n .\n    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n .\n    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,\n    LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR\n    WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,\n    STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES\n    OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\n    NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n    ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n    DISCOVERABLE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF\n    IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n .\n    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY\n    APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY\n    LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\n    OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE\n    WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n    DAMAGES.\n .\n    7. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder\n     will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms\n     of this License.  Individuals or entities who have received\n     Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however,\n     will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals\n     or entities remain in full compliance with those\n     licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any\n     termination of this License.  b. Subject to the above terms and\n     conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the\n     duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding\n     the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under\n     different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any\n     time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n     withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\n     required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\n     License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated\n     as stated above.\n .\n    8. Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform\n     the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a\n     license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the\n     license granted to You under this License.  b. Each time You\n     Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to\n     the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and\n     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\n     under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\n     enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and\n     without further action by the parties to this agreement, such\n     provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to\n     make such provision valid and enforceable.  d. No term or\n     provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach\n     consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and\n     signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the\n     parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no\n     understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the\n     Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any\n     additional provisions that may appear in any communication from\n     You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\n     agreement of the Licensor and You.  f. The rights granted under,\n     and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted\n     utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the\n     Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September\n     28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty\n     of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and\n     the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24,\n     1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\n     jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\n     those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\n     standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\n     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\n     additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\n     License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights\n     under applicable law.\n .\n Creative Commons Notice\n .\n      Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no\n      warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons\n      will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for\n      any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general,\n      special, incidental or consequential damages arising in\n      connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2)\n      sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as\n      the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations\n      of Licensor.\n .\n      Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that\n      the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not\n      authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative\n      Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons\n      without the prior written consent of Creative Commons.

For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction\n      does not form part of this License.\n .\n      Creative Commons may be contacted at http://creativecommons.org/\n ."

TO THE EXTENT THIS\n LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU\n THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH\n TERMS AND CONDITIONS.\n .\n 1. Definitions.\n .\n a. \"Collective Work\" means a work, such as a periodical issue,\n anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in\n unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions,\n constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are\n assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a\n Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined\n below) for the purposes of this License.\n .\n b. \"Creative Commons Compatible License\" means a license that is\n listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been\n approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this\n License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains\n terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License\n Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing\n of derivatives of works made available under that license under this\n License or either a Creative Commons unported license or a Creative\n Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this\n License.\n .\n c. \"Derivative Work\" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work\n and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical\n arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,\n sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any\n other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,\n except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be\n considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the\n avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound\n recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a\n moving image (\"synching\") will be considered a Derivative Work for the\n purpose of this License.\n .\n d. \"License Elements\" means the following high-level license\n attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this\n License: Attribution, ShareAlike.\n .\n e. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities\n that offers the Work under the terms of this License.\n .\n f. \"Original Author\" means the individual, individuals, entity or\n entities who created the Work.\n .\n g. \"Work\" means the copyrighted voice prompt files recorded by Allison\n Smith for Asterisk and distributed with this License.\n .\n h. \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\n License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with\n respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the\n Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous\n violation.\n .\n 2. Fair Use Rights.\n .\n Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any\n rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the\n exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other\n applicable laws.\n .\n 3. License Grant.\n .\n Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby\n grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for\n the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the\n rights in the Work as stated below:\n .\n a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n Collective Works;\n .\n b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such\n Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes\n reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify\n that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a\n translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from\n English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original\n work has been modified.\";\n .\n c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform\n publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio\n transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;\n .\n d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform\n publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio\n transmission Derivative Works.\n .\n e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical\n composition:\n .\n  i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the\n  exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the event\n  that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society\n  (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public\n  performance or public digital performance e.g. webcast) of the Work.\n .\n  ii.Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the\n  exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music\n  rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties\n  for any phonorecord You create from the Work (\"cover version\") and\n  distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC\n  Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other\n  jurisdictions).\n .\n f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of\n doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the\n exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a\n performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the\n public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the\n compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright\n Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).\n .\n The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\n known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\n such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights\n in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by\n Licensor are hereby reserved.\n .\n 4. Restrictions.\n .\n The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to\n and limited by the following restrictions:\n .\n a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and\n You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,\n this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You\n distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally\n perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that\n restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a recipient of\n the Work to exercise of the rights granted to that recipient under the\n terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep\n intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n warranties. When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,\n or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any\n technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a\n recipient of the Work from You to exercise of the rights granted to\n that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)\n applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this\n does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be\n made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective\n Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by\n Section 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon\n notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove\n from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as\n requested.\n .\n b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n digitally perform a Derivative Work only under: (i) the terms of this\n License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License\n Elements as this License; (iii) either the Creative Commons (Unported)\n license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a\n later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this\n License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (Unported)); (iv) a Creative\n Commons Compatible License. If you license the Derivative Work under\n one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms\n of that license. If you license the Derivative Work under the terms of\n any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable\n License\"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License\n generally and with the following provisions: (I) You must include a\n copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, the Applicable\n License with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You\n distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally\n perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative\n Works that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability\n of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that\n recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must\n keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to\n the disclaimer of warranties; and, (IV) when You distribute, publicly\n display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You\n may not impose any technological measures on the Derivative Work that\n restrict the ability of a recipient of the Derivative Work from You to\n exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the\n Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Derivative Work\n as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the\n Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made\n subject to the terms of the Applicable License.\n .\n c. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly\n digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any\n Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works\n (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been\n made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for\n the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are\n utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if\n applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or\n Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,\n publishing entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in\n Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable\n means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if\n supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource\n Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the\n Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or\n licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b)\n in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the\n Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by\n Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented\n in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a\n Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will\n appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative\n Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in\n a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other\n contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the\n credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the\n manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n Parties.\n .\n 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer.\n .\n UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,\n LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS\n HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO\n REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,\n EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT\n LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY,\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\n LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF\n ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\n THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY\n TO YOU.\n .\n 6. Limitation on Liability.\n .\n EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL\n LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,\n INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT\n OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n .\n 7. Termination.\n .\n a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this\n License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or\n Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have\n their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain\n in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8\n will survive any termination of this License.\n .\n b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\n is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the\n Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to\n release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing\n the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will\n not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has\n been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),\n and this License will continue in full force and effect unless\n terminated as stated above.\n .\n 8. Miscellaneous.\n .\n a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as\n defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in\n Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to\n the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to\n You under this License.\n .\n b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative\n Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work\n on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under\n this License.\n .\n c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of\n the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action\n by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to\n the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and\n enforceable.\n .\n d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing\n and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n .\n e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\n with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.",

Definitions a. \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or\n     upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,\n     adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other\n     alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or\n     performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other\n     form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted\n     including in any form recognizably derived from the original,\n     except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be\n     considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the\n     avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance\n     or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation\n     with a moving image (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation\n     for the purpose of this License.  b. \"Collection\" means a\n     collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias\n     and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or\n     other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section\n     1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of\n     their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the\n     Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one\n     or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\n     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into\n     a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not\n     be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of\n     this License.  c. \"Distribute\" means to make available to the\n     public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as\n     appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.\n     d. \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or\n     entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n     e. \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic\n     work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created\n     the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the\n     publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the\n     actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,\n     sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform\n     literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the\n     case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity\n     who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,\n     (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits\n     the broadcast.  f. \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work\n     offered under the terms of this License including without\n     limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic\n     domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression\n     including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other\n     writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same\n     nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work\n     or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or\n     without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated\n     works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work\n     of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or\n     lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works\n     expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied\n     art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work\n     relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a\n     performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to\n     the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work\n     performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not\n     otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.  g. \"You\" means\n     an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who\n     has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect\n     to the Work, or who has received express permission from the\n     Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous\n     violation.  h. \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public\n     recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those\n     public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or\n     wireless means or public digital performances; to make available\n     to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may\n     access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen\n     by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process\n     and the communication to the public of the performances of the\n     Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and\n     rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or\n     images.  i. \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any\n     means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings\n     and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work,\n     including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in\n     digital form or other electronic medium.\n .\n    2.

Nothing in this License is intended to\n    reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights\n    arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in\n    connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or\n    other applicable laws.\n .\n    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this\n    License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n    non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable\n    copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated\n    below: a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one\n    or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in\n    the Collections; b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided\n    that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,\n    takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise\n    identify that changes were made to the original Work.

Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n    which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n    compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the\n    exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You\n    of the rights granted under this License; and, iii. Voluntary\n    License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect\n    royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor\n    is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary\n    licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of\n    the rights granted under this License.\n .\n    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether\n    now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right\n    to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise\n    the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all\n    rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n .\n    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is\n    expressly made subject to and limited by the following\n    restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work\n    only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of,\n    or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with\n    every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may\n    not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms\n    of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to\n    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of\n    the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact\n    all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of\n    warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may\n    not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that\n    restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to\n    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of\n    the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated\n    in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart\n    from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this\n    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor\n    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any\n    credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an\n    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent\n    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by\n    Section 4(b), as requested.  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly\n    Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must,\n    unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep\n    intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable\n    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the\n    Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or\n    if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or\n    parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for\n    attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in Licensor's copyright notice,\n    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such\n    party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to\n    the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor\n    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not\n    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the\n    Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an\n    Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the\n    Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by Original\n    Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n    Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be\n    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in\n    the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit\n    will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the\n    Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and\n    in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other\n    contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use\n    the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution\n    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under\n    this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply\n    any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original\n    Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You\n    or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior\n    written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or\n    Attribution Parties.  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by\n    the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if\n    You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by\n    itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not\n    distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in\n    relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original\n    Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those\n    jurisdictions (e.g.  Japan), in which any exercise of the right\n    granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make\n    Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,\n    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original\n    Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not\n    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent\n    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to\n    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License\n    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n .\n    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n .\n    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,\n    LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR\n    WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,\n    STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES\n    OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,\n    NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n    ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n    DISCOVERABLE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF\n    IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n .\n    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY\n    APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY\n    LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE\n    OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE\n    WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH\n    DAMAGES.\n .\n    7. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder\n     will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms\n     of this License.  Individuals or entities who have received\n     Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however,\n     will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals\n     or entities remain in full compliance with those\n     licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any\n     termination of this License.  b. Subject to the above terms and\n     conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the\n     duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding\n     the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under\n     different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any\n     time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to\n     withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is\n     required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this\n     License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated\n     as stated above.\n .\n    8. Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform\n     the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a\n     license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the\n     license granted to You under this License.  b. Each time You\n     Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to\n     the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and\n     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.\n     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable\n     under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or\n     enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and\n     without further action by the parties to this agreement, such\n     provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to\n     make such provision valid and enforceable.  d. No term or\n     provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach\n     consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and\n     signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.\n     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the\n     parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no\n     understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the\n     Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any\n     additional provisions that may appear in any communication from\n     You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written\n     agreement of the Licensor and You.  f. The rights granted under,\n     and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted\n     utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the\n     Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September\n     28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty\n     of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and\n     the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24,\n     1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant\n     jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced\n     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of\n     those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the\n     standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law\n     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such\n     additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this\n     License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights\n     under applicable law.\n .\n Creative Commons Notice\n .\n      Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no\n      warranty whatsoever in connection with the Work. Creative Commons\n      will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for\n      any damages whatsoever, including without limitation any general,\n      special, incidental or consequential damages arising in\n      connection to this license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2)\n      sentences, if Creative Commons has expressly identified itself as\n      the Licensor hereunder, it shall have all rights and obligations\n      of Licensor.\n .\n      Except for the limited purpose of indicating to the public that\n      the Work is licensed under the CCPL, Creative Commons does not\n      authorize the use by either party of the trademark \"Creative\n      Commons\" or any related trademark or logo of Creative Commons\n      without the prior written consent of Creative Commons.

For the avoidance of doubt, this trademark restriction\n      does not form part of this License.\n .\n      Creative Commons may be contacted at http://creativecommons.org/\n ."

If you obtained Asterisk under the GPL, then the GPL\n applies to all loadable Asterisk modules used on your system as well,\n except as defined below. The GPL (version 2) is included in this\n source tree in the file COPYING.\n .\n This package also includes various components that are not part of\n Asterisk itself; these components are in the 'contrib' directory\n and its subdirectories. These components are also distributed under the\n GPL version 2 as well.\n .\n Digium, Inc. (formerly Linux Support Services) holds copyright\n and/or sufficient licenses to all components of the Asterisk\n package, and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability\n for companies, individuals, or organizations to create proprietary or\n Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may be dynamically linked at\n runtime with the portions of Asterisk which fall under our\n copyright/license umbrella, or are distributed under more flexible\n licenses than GPL.\n .\n If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry --\n there is no requirement that you provide the same exception in your\n GPL'd products (although if you've written a module for Asterisk we\n would strongly encourage you to make the same exception that we do).\n .\n Specific permission is also granted to link Asterisk with OpenSSL, OpenH323\n and/or the UW IMAP Toolkit and distribute the resulting binary files.\n .\n In addition, Asterisk implements two management/control protocols: the\n Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and the Asterisk Gateway Interface\n (AGI). It is our belief that applications using these protocols to\n manage or control an Asterisk instance do not have to be licensed\n under the GPL or a compatible license, as we believe these protocols\n do not create a 'derivative work' as referred to in the GPL. However,\n should any court or other judiciary body find that these protocols do\n fall under the terms of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a license to\n use these protocols in combination with Asterisk in external\n applications licensed under any license you wish.\n .\n The 'Asterisk' name and logos are trademarks owned by Digium, Inc.,\n and use of them is subject to our trademark licensing policies. If you\n wish to use these trademarks for purposes other than simple\n redistribution of Asterisk source code obtained from Digium, you\n should contact our licensing department to determine the necessary\n steps you must take.

TO THE EXTENT THIS\n LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE\n RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS\n AND CONDITIONS.\n .\n 1. Definitions\n .\n  a \"Adaptation\" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and\n    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,\n    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a\n    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes\n    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may\n    be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form\n    recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that\n    constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for\n    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the\n    Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the\n    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image\n    (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of\n    this License.\n  b \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such\n    as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or\n    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed\n    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and\n    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in\n    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along\n    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\n    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a\n    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be\n    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this\n    License.\n  c \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and\n    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or\n    other transfer of ownership.\n  d \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities\n    that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n  e \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,\n    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work\n    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and\n    in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,\n    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver,\n    declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or\n    artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a\n    phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first\n    fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the\n    case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n  f \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the\n    terms of this License including without limitation any production in\n    the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the\n    mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a\n    book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or\n    other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work;\n    a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical\n    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which\n    are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to\n    cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,\n    sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which\n    are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to\n    photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,\n    sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,\n    architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a\n    compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable\n    work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the\n    extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n  g \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\n    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License\n    with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission\n    from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a\n    previous violation.\n  h \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work\n    and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any\n    means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public\n    digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such\n    a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place\n    and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to\n    the public by any means or process and the communication to the\n    public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital\n    performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means\n    including signs, sounds or images.\n  i \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including\n    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of\n    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of\n    a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other\n    electronic medium.\n .\n 2.

Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,\n limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from\n limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the\n copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n .\n 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\n Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\n perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\n exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n .\n  a to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n    Collections;\n  b to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such\n    Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes\n    reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify\n    that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a\n    translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from\n    English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original\n    work has been modified.\";\n  c to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as\n    incorporated in Collections; and,\n  d to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n  f For the avoidance of doubt:\n    i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions\n       in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n       compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\n       reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\n       exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives\n        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise\n        by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to\n         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that\n         the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that\n         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from\n         any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n .\n The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\n known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\n such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights\n in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not\n expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n .\n 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\n    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n .\n  a You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\n    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any\n    terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the\n    ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted\n    to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not\n    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to\n    this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of\n    the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or\n    Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective\n    technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a\n    recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to\n    that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)\n    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does\n    not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made\n    subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,\n    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,\n    remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b),\n    as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any\n    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the\n    Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n  b If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations\n    or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)\n    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if\n    supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate\n    another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing\n    entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in\n    Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable\n    means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work\n    if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if\n    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless\n    such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\n    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b),\n    in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the\n    Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by\n    Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n    Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be\n    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the\n    case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will\n    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation\n    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner\n    at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing\n    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit\n    required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the\n    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n    Parties.\n  c Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute\n    or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify\n    or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would\n    be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.\n    Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which\n    any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License\n    (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,\n    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to\n    the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive\n    or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent\n    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to\n    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License\n    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n .\n 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n .\n UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\n OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\n KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\n INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\n LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF\n ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\n THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO\n YOU.\n .\n 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\n LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\n ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\n ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR\n HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n .\n 7. Termination\n .\n  a This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n    survive any termination of this License.\n  b Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\n    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the\n    Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to\n    release the Work under different license terms or to stop\n    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such\n    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other\n    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms\n    of this License), and this License will continue in full force and\n    effect unless terminated as stated above.\n .\n 8. Miscellaneous\n .\n  a Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\n    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the\n    Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You\n    under this License.\n  b Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this\n    License.\n  c If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability\n    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further\n    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be\n    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision\n    valid and enforceable.\n  d No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\n    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or\n    consent.\n  e This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\n    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and\n    You.\n  f The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne\n    Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as\n    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the\n    WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms\n    Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on\n    July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the\n    relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be\n    enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the\n    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national\n    law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable\n    copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this\n    License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the\n    License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any\n    rights under applicable law.",

If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any\n    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the\n    Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.\n  b You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the\n    terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License\n    with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative\n    Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license\n    version) that contains the same License Elements as this License\n    (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons\n    Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the\n    licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that\n    license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the\n    licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"),\n    you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally\n    and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the\n    URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation\n    You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose\n    any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the\n    Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation\n    to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of\n    the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that\n    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties\n    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective\n    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability\n    of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights\n    granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.\n    This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a\n    Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the\n    Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable\n    License.\n  c If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations\n    or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)\n    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if\n    supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate\n    another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing\n    entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in\n    Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable\n    means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work\n    if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if\n    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless\n    such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\n    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),\n    in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the\n    Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by\n    Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n    Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be\n    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the\n    case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will\n    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation\n    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner\n    at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing\n    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit\n    required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the\n    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n    Parties.\n  d Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute\n    or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify\n    or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would\n    be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.\n    Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which\n    any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License\n    (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,\n    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to\n    the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive\n    or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent\n    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to\n    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License\n    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n .\n 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n .\n UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\n OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\n KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\n INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\n LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF\n ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\n THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO\n YOU.\n .\n 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\n LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\n ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\n ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR\n HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n .\n 7. Termination\n .\n  a This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n    survive any termination of this License.\n  b Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\n    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the\n    Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to\n    release the Work under different license terms or to stop\n    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such\n    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other\n    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms\n    of this License), and this License will continue in full force and\n    effect unless terminated as stated above.\n .\n 8. Miscellaneous\n .\n  a Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\n    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the\n    Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You\n    under this License.\n  b Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this\n    License.\n  c If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability\n    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further\n    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be\n    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision\n    valid and enforceable.\n  d No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\n    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or\n    consent.\n  e This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\n    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and\n    You.\n  f The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne\n    Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as\n    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the\n    WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms\n    Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on\n    July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the\n    relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be\n    enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the\n    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national\n    law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable\n    copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this\n    License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the\n    License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any\n    rights under applicable law.",

A work that constitutes a Collection will not be\n    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this\n    License.\n  c \"Distribute\" means to make available to the public the original and\n    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or\n    other transfer of ownership.\n  d \"Licensor\" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities\n    that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.\n  e \"Original Author\" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,\n    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work\n    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and\n    in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,\n    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver,\n    declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or\n    artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a\n    phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first\n    fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the\n    case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.\n  f \"Work\" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the\n    terms of this License including without limitation any production in\n    the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the\n    mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a\n    book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or\n    other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work;\n    a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical\n    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which\n    are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to\n    cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,\n    sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which\n    are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to\n    photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,\n    sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,\n    architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a\n    compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable\n    work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the\n    extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.\n  g \"You\" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this\n    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License\n    with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission\n    from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a\n    previous violation.\n  h \"Publicly Perform\" means to perform public recitations of the Work\n    and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any\n    means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public\n    digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such\n    a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place\n    and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to\n    the public by any means or process and the communication to the\n    public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital\n    performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means\n    including signs, sounds or images.\n  i \"Reproduce\" means to make copies of the Work by any means including\n    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of\n    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of\n    a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other\n    electronic medium.\n .\n 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,\n limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from\n limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the\n copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.\n .\n 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,\n Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,\n perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to\n exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:\n .\n  a to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more\n    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the\n    Collections;\n  b to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such\n    Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes\n    reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify\n    that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a\n    translation could be marked \"The original work was translated from\n    English to Spanish,\" or a modification could indicate \"The original\n    work has been modified.\";\n  c to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as\n    incorporated in Collections; and,\n  d to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.\n  f For the avoidance of doubt:\n    i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions\n       in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n       compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor\n       reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any\n       exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;\n    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in\n        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or\n        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives\n        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise\n        by You of the rights granted under this License; and,\n    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to\n         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that\n         the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that\n         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from\n         any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.\n .\n The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now\n known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make\n such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights\n in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not\n expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.\n .\n 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly\n    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:\n .\n  a You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms\n    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any\n    terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the\n    ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted\n    to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not\n    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to\n    this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of\n    the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or\n    Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective\n    technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a\n    recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to\n    that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)\n    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does\n    not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made\n    subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,\n    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,\n    remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b),\n    as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any\n    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the\n    Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.\n  b If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations\n    or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)\n    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if\n    supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate\n    another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing\n    entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in\n    Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable\n    means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work\n    if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if\n    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless\n    such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\n    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b),\n    in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the\n    Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by\n    Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n    Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be\n    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the\n    case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will\n    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation\n    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner\n    at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing\n    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit\n    required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the\n    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n    Parties.\n  c Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute\n    or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify\n    or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would\n    be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.\n    Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which\n    any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License\n    (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,\n    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to\n    the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive\n    or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent\n    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to\n    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License\n    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n .\n 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n .\n UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\n OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\n KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\n INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\n LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF\n ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\n THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO\n YOU.\n .\n 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\n LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\n ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\n ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR\n HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n .\n 7. Termination\n .\n  a This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n    survive any termination of this License.\n  b Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\n    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the\n    Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to\n    release the Work under different license terms or to stop\n    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such\n    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other\n    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms\n    of this License), and this License will continue in full force and\n    effect unless terminated as stated above.\n .\n 8. Miscellaneous\n .\n  a Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\n    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the\n    Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You\n    under this License.\n  b Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this\n    License.\n  c If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability\n    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further\n    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be\n    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision\n    valid and enforceable.\n  d No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\n    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or\n    consent.\n  e This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\n    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and\n    You.\n  f The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne\n    Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as\n    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the\n    WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms\n    Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on\n    July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the\n    relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be\n    enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the\n    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national\n    law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable\n    copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this\n    License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the\n    License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any\n    rights under applicable law.",

For the avoidance of doubt, where the\n    Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the\n    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image\n    (\"synching\") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of\n    this License.\n  b \"Collection\" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such\n    as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or\n    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed\n    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and\n    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in\n    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along\n    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and\n    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a\n    collective whole.

You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource\n    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any\n    terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the\n    ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted\n    to that recipient under the terms of the License.

If you license the Adaptation under one of the\n    licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that\n    license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the\n    licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the \"Applicable License\"),\n    you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally\n    and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the\n    URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation\n    You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose\n    any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the\n    Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation\n    to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of\n    the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that\n    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties\n    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You\n    Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly\n    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective\n    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability\n    of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights\n    granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.\n    This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a\n    Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the\n    Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable\n    License.\n  c If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations\n    or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to\n    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and\n    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)\n    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if\n    supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate\n    another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing\n    entity, journal) for attribution (\"Attribution Parties\") in\n    Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable\n    means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work\n    if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if\n    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless\n    such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing\n    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),\n    in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the\n    Work in the Adaptation (e.g., \"French translation of the Work by\n    Original Author,\" or \"Screenplay based on original Work by Original\n    Author\"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be\n    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the\n    case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will\n    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation\n    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner\n    at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing\n    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit\n    required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the\n    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this\n    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any\n    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,\n    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your\n    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written\n    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution\n    Parties.\n  d Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be\n    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute\n    or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any\n    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify\n    or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would\n    be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.\n    Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which\n    any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License\n    (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,\n    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to\n    the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive\n    or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent\n    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to\n    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License\n    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.\n .\n 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer\n .\n UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR\n OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY\n KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,\n INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,\n FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF\n LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF\n ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW\n THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO\n YOU.\n .\n 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE\n LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR\n ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES\n ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR\n HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.\n .\n 7. Termination\n .\n  a This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate\n    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.\n    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections\n    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses\n    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full\n    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will\n    survive any termination of this License.\n  b Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here\n    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the\n    Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to\n    release the Work under different license terms or to stop\n    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such\n    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other\n    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms\n    of this License), and this License will continue in full force and\n    effect unless terminated as stated above.\n .\n 8. Miscellaneous\n .\n  a Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a\n    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the\n    Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You\n    under this License.\n  b Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor\n    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same\n    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this\n    License.\n  c If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under\n    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability\n    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further\n    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be\n    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision\n    valid and enforceable.\n  d No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no\n    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in\n    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or\n    consent.\n  e This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties\n    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,\n    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified\n    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that\n    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be\n    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and\n    You.\n  f The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this\n    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne\n    Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as\n    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the\n    WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms\n    Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on\n    July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the\n    relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be\n    enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the\n    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national\n    law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable\n    copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this\n    License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the\n    License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any\n    rights under applicable law.",
