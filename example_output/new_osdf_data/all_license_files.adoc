 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.

 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 1.  "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
     other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
     derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
     literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
     cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
     be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
     recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
     constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
     Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
     synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
     ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
     this License.
 2.  "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
     as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
     broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
     in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
     arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
     which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
     with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
     collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
     considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
     License.
 3.  "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed
     at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
     approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
     License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
     terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
     Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
     relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that

 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 1.  to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collections;
 2.  to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
     Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
     reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
     translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
     English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
     work has been modified.";
 3.  to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
     incorporated in Collections; and,
 4.  to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 5.  For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
     1.  Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
         in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
         reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
         exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
     2.  Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
         by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
     3.  Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
         the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
         any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 1.  You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
     of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
     terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
     ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
     to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
     sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
     this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
     the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
     technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
     that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
     applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
     not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
     subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c),
     as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
 2.  You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
     terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License
     with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative
     Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
     version) that contains the same License Elements as this License
     (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
     Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the
     licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
     license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the
     licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
     you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally
     and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the
     URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation
     You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose
     any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the
     Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
     to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
     the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
     refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
     with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly
     Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
     technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability
     of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights
     granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
     This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
     Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the
     Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
     License.
 3.  If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
     or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
     Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
     provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
     the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
     supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
     another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
     entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
     Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
     means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
     if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
     such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
     information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
     in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
     Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
     Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
     Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
     implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
     case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
     appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
     or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
     at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
     authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
     required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
     manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
     License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
     connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
     Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
     use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
     permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
     Parties.
 4.  Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
     or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
     Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
     or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
     be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
     Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
     any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
     (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
     mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
     the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
     or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
     permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
     reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
     (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
     from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
     terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
     compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
     survive any termination of this License.
 2.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
     of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
     effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 1.  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
     Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
 2.  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
     offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
     License.
 3.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
 4.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
 5.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
     You.
 6.  The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
     Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
     amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
     WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
     Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
     July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
     relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
     enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
     law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
     copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
     License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
     License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
     rights under applicable law.

 Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and

 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 .
      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
 	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 .
      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
   a. License grant.
 .
        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                in part; and
 .
             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
           its terms and conditions.
 .
        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
           6(a).
 .
        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
           (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
        5. Downstream recipients.
 .
             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                Public License.
 .
             b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
             c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                Material.
 .
        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
   b. Other rights.
 .
        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
           Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
           Public License.
 .
        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
           reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
   a. Attribution.
 .
        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
           form), You must:
 .
             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                with the Licensed Material:
 .
                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                     Material and any others designated to receive
                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                     designated);
 .
                 ii. a copyright notice;
 .
                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                     warranties;
 .
                  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                     extent reasonably practicable;
 .
             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
           information.
 .
        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
           reasonably practicable.
 .
   b. ShareAlike.
 .
      In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
      Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 .
        1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
           license with the same License Elements, this version or
           later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
 .
        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
           Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
           in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
           context in which You Share Adapted Material.
 .
        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
           or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
           Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
           rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
      portion of the contents of the database;
 .
   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
 .
      including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
      waiver of all liability.
 .
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
      terminate automatically.
 .
   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
           violation; or
 .
        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
      of this Public License.
 .
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
      will not terminate this Public License.
 .
   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
      License.
 .
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 .
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
      be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
      conditions.
 .
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
      Licensor.
 .
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

   ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
   INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES

 License
 .
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
 TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
 BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 1.  "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
     unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined
     below) for the purposes of this License.
 2.  "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
     and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
     arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
     version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
     condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
     transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
     purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
     is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
     the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
     considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
 3.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
     that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
 4.  "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or
     entities who created the Work.
 5.  "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
     terms of this License.
 6.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
 limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 1.  to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collective Works;
 2.  to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
     Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes
     reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
     translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
     English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
     work has been modified.";;
 3.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
 4.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission Derivative Works.
 5.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
 .
     1.  Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the
         event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society
         (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the
         public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
         of the Work.
     2.  Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
         rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
         royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover
         version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
         created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
         equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 6.  Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
     doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
     exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
     performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
     public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
     the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
     Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
 are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 1.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and
     You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
     this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
     that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
     and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work,
     You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that
     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
     the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.
     This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
     Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
     from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
     License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
     requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
     requested.
 2.  If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
     Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works
     (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been
     made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
     the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
     utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
     applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
     Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
     other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title
     of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the
     Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
     associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
     copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and,
     consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a
     credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
     "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
     this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
     Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
     for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective
     Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
     as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For
     the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
     Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
     implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
     sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
     without the separate, express prior written permission of the
     Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE
 LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
 OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
 MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
 THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
 JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works (as
     defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in
     Section 1 above) from You under this License, however, will not have
     their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
     remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
     7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 2.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
     of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
     effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 1.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
     defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in
     Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
     the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
     You under this License.
 2.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
     Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
 3.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
 4.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
 5.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
     You.
 .
   Creative Commons Notice
 .
   Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty

   liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
   whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
   incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
   license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
   Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
   shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 1.  "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
     unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined
     below) for the purposes of this License.
 2.  "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed
     at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
     approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
     License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
     terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
     Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
     relicensing of derivatives of works made available under that
     license under this License or either a Creative Commons unported
     license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same
     License Elements as this License.
 3.  "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
     and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
     arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
     version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
     condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
     transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
     purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
     is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
     the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
     considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
 4.  "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes
     as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
     Attribution, ShareAlike.
 5.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
     that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
 6.  "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or
     entities who created the Work.
 7.  "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
     terms of this License.
 8.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
 limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 1.  to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collective Works;
 2.  to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
     Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes
     reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
     translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
     English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
     work has been modified.";
 3.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
 4.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission Derivative Works.
 5.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
 .
     1.  Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the
         event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society
         (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the
         public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
         of the Work.
     2.  Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
         rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
         royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover
         version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
         created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
         equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 6.  Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
     doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
     exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
     performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
     public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
     the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
     Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
 are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 1.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and
     You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
     this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
     that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a
     recipient of the Work to exercise of the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
     and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work,
     You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that
     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
     of the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
     License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
     Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
     from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
     License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
     requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
     requested.
 2.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform a Derivative Work only under: (i) the terms of
     this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
     License Elements as this License; (iii) either the Creative Commons
     (Unported) license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license
     (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
     License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
     (Unported)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you
     license the Derivative Work under one of the licenses mentioned in
     (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license
     the Derivative Work under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned
     in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply
     with the terms of the Applicable License generally and with the
     following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
     Resource Identifier for, the Applicable License with every copy or
     phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform; (II) You
     may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that
     restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of a
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must
     keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to
     the disclaimer of warranties; and, (IV) when You distribute,
     publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
     the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the
     Derivative Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
     Derivative Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section
     4(b) applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
     Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
     Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of the
     Applicable License.
 3.  If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
     Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works
     (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been
     made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
     the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
     utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
     applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
     Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
     other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title
     of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the
     Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
     associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
     copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and,
     consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a
     credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
     "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
     this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
     Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
     for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective
     Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
     as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For
     the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
     Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
     implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
     sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
     without the separate, express prior written permission of the
     Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE
 LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
 OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
 MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
 THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
 JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
     Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
     their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
     remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
     7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 2.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
     of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
     effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 1.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
     defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in
     Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
     the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
     You under this License.
 2.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
     Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
 3.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
 4.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
 5.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
     You.

 La Licenza
 .
 L’OPERA (COME SOTTO DEFINITA) È MESSA A DISPOSIZIONE SULLA BASE DEI
 TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA “CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE” (‘CCPL’
 O ‘LICENZA’). L’OPERA E’ PROTETTA DAL DIRITTO D’AUTORE E/O DALLE ALTRE
 LEGGI APPLICABILI. OGNI UTILIZZAZIONE DELL’OPERA CHE NON SIA AUTORIZZATA
 AI SENSI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA O DEL DIRITTO D’AUTORE È PROIBITA.
 .
 CON IL SEMPLICE ESERCIZIO SULL’OPERA DI UNO QUALUNQUE DEI DIRITTI QUI DI
 SEGUITO ELENCATI, TU ACCETTI E TI OBBLIGHI A RISPETTARE INTEGRALMENTE I
 TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA AI SENSI DEL PUNTO 8.f. IL LICENZIANTE
 CONCEDE A TE I DIRITTI QUI DI SEGUITO ELENCATI A CONDIZIONE CHE TU

 1. Definizioni. Ai fini e per gli effetti della presente licenza, si
 intende per
 .
 1.  "Collezione di Opere", un’opera, come un numero di un periodico,
     un’antologia o un’enciclopedia, nella quale l’Opera nella sua
     interezza e forma originale, unitamente ad altri contributi
     costituenti loro stessi opere distinte ed autonome, sono raccolti in
     un’unità collettiva. Un’opera che costituisce Collezione di Opere
     non verrà considerata Opera Derivata (come sotto definita) ai fini
     della presente Licenza;
 2.  "Opera Derivata", un’opera basata sull’Opera ovvero sull’Opera
     insieme con altre opere preesistenti, come una traduzione, un
     arrangiamento musicale, un adattamento teatrale, narrativo,
     cinematografico, una registrazione di suoni, una riproduzione
     d’arte, un digesto, una sintesi, od ogni altra forma in cui l’Opera
     possa essere riproposta, trasformata o adattata. Nel caso in cui
     un’Opera tra quelle qui descritte costituisca già Collezione di
     Opere, essa non sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini della
     presente Licenza. Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, quando
     l’Opera sia una composizione musicale o registrazione di suoni, la
     sincronizzazione dell’Opera in relazione con un’immagine in
     movimento (“synching”) sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini di
     questa Licenza;
 3.  "Licenziante", l’individuo o l’ente che offre l’Opera secondo i
     termini e le condizioni della presente Licenza;
 4.  "Autore Originario", il soggetto che ha creato l’Opera;
 5.  "Opera", l’opera dell’ingegno suscettibile di protezione in forza
     delle leggi sul diritto d’autore, la cui utilizzazione è offerta nel
     rispetto dei termini della presente Licenza;
 6.  "Tu"/"Te", l’individuo o l’ente che esercita i diritti derivanti
     dalla presente Licenza e che non abbia precedentemente violato i
     termini della presente Licenza relativi all’Opera, o che, nonostante
     una precedente violazione degli stessi, abbia ricevuto espressa
     autorizzazione dal Licenziante all’esercizio dei diritti derivanti
     dalla presente Licenza;
 7.  "Elementi della Licenza", gli attributi fondamentali della Licenza
     scelti dal Licenziante ed indicati nel titolo della Licenza:
     Attribuzione, Condividi allo stesso modo.
 .
 2. Libere utilizzazioni. La presente Licenza non intende in alcun modo
 ridurre, limitare o restringere alcun diritto di libera utilizzazione o
 l’operare della regola dell’esaurimento del diritto o altre limitazioni
 dei diritti esclusivi sull’Opera derivanti dalla legge sul diritto
 d’autore o da altre leggi applicabili.
 .
 3. Concessione della Licenza. Nel rispetto dei termini e delle
 condizioni contenute nella presente Licenza, il Licenziante concede a Te
 una licenza per tutto il mondo, gratuita, non esclusiva e perpetua (per
 la durata del diritto d’autore applicabile) che autorizza ad esercitare
 i diritti sull’Opera qui di seguito elencati:
 .
 1.  riproduzione dell’Opera, incorporazione dell’Opera in una o più
     Collezioni di Opere e riproduzione dell’Opera come incorporata nelle
     Collezioni di Opere;
 2.  creazione e riproduzione di un’Opera Derivata;
 3.  distribuzione di copie dell’Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui
     l’Opera è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico, rappresentazione,
     esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico, ivi inclusa la
     trasmissione audio digitale dell’Opera, e ciò anche quando l’Opera
     sia incorporata in Collezioni di Opere;
 4.  distribuzione di copie dell’Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui
     l’Opera Derivata è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico,
     rappresentazione, esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico,
     ivi inclusa la trasmissione audio digitale di Opere Derivate.
 5.  Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, se l’Opera sia di tipo
     musicale
 .
     1.  Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione
         od esecuzione di opere incluse in repertori. Il Licenziante
         rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi,
         personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva
         (ad es. SIAE), per la comunicazione al pubblico o la
         rappresentazione od esecuzione, anche in forma digitale (ad es.
         tramite webcast) dell’Opera.
     2.  Compensi per versioni cover. Il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto
         esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite
         di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per ogni disco
         che Tu crei e distribuisci a partire dall’Opera (versione
         cover).
 .
 6.  Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico dell’Opera mediante
     fonogrammi. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che se l’Opera è una
     registrazione di suoni, il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo
     di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di
     gestione collettiva (ad es. IMAIE), per la comunicazione al pubblico
     dell’Opera, anche in forma digitale.
 7.  Altri compensi previsti dalla legge italiana. Al fine di evitare
     dubbi, è inteso che il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di
     riscuotere i compensi a lui attribuiti dalla legge italiana sul
     diritto d’autore (ad es. per l’inserimento dell’Opera in
     un’antologia ad uso scolastico ex art. 70 l. 633/1941). Al
     Licenziante spettano in ogni caso i compensi irrinunciabili a lui
     attribuiti dalla medesima legge (ad es. l’equo compenso spettante
     all’autore di opere musicali, cinematografiche, audiovisive o di
     sequenze di immagini in movimento nel caso di noleggio ai sensi
     dell’art. 18-bis l. 633/1941).
 .
 I diritti sopra descritti potranno essere esercitati con ogni mezzo di
 comunicazione e in tutti i formati. Tra i diritti di cui sopra si
 intende compreso il diritto di apportare all’Opera le modifiche che si
 rendessero tecnicamente necessarie per l’esercizio di detti diritti
 tramite altri mezzi di comunicazione o su altri formati. Tutti i diritti
 non espressamente concessi dal Licenziante rimangono riservati.
 .
 4. Restrizioni. La Licenza concessa in conformità al precedente punto 3
 è espressamente assoggettata a, e limitata da, le seguenti restrizioni
 .
 1.  Tu puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare,
     eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera, anche in forma
     digitale, solo assicurando che i termini di cui alla presente
     Licenza siano rispettati e, insieme ad ogni copia dell’Opera (o
     supporto fonografico su cui è registrata l’Opera) che distribuisci,
     comunichi al pubblico o rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in
     pubblico, anche in forma digitale, devi includere una copia della
     presente Licenza o il suo Uniform Resource Identifier. Non puoi
     proporre od imporre alcuna condizione relativa all’Opera che alteri
     o restringa i termini della presente Licenza o l’esercizio da parte
     del beneficiario dei diritti qui concessi. Non puoi concedere
     l’Opera in sublicenza. Devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative
     che si riferiscono alla presente Licenza ed all’esclusione delle
     garanzie. Non puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico,
     rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera,
     neanche in forma digitale, usando misure tecnologiche miranti a
     controllare l’accesso all’Opera ovvero l’uso dell’Opera, in maniera
     incompatibile con i termini della presente Licenza. Quanto sopra si
     applica all’Opera anche quando questa faccia parte di una Collezione
     di Opere, anche se ciò non comporta che la Collezione di Opere di
     per sé ed indipendentemente dall’Opera stessa debba essere soggetta
     ai termini ed alle condizioni della presente Licenza. Qualora Tu
     crei una Collezione di Opere, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante,
     devi rimuovere dalla Collezione di Opere stessa, ove materialmente
     possibile, ogni riferimento a tale Licenziante o, su richiesta di
     qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale Autore Originario, come da
     richiesta. Qualora tu crei un’Opera Derivata, su richiesta di
     qualsiasi Licenziante devi rimuovere dall’Opera Derivata stessa,
     nella misura in cui ciò sia possibile, ogni riferimento a tale
     Licenziante o, su richiesta di qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale
     Autore Originario, come da richiesta.
 2.  Tu puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare,
     eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera, anche in forma
     digitale, solo assicurando che i termini di cui alla presente
     Licenza siano rispettati e, insieme ad ogni copia dell’Opera (o
     supporto fonografico su cui è registrata l’Opera) che distribuisci,
     comunichi al pubblico o rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in
     pubblico, anche in forma digitale, devi includere una copia della
     presente Licenza o il suo Uniform Resource Identifier. Non puoi
     proporre od imporre alcuna condizione relativa all’Opera che alteri
     o restringa i termini della presente Licenza o l’esercizio da parte
     del beneficiario dei diritti qui concessi. Non puoi concedere
     l’Opera in sublicenza. Devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative
     che si riferiscono alla presente Licenza ed all’esclusione delle
     garanzie. Non puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico,
     rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera,
     neanche in forma digitale, usando misure tecnologiche miranti a
     controllare l’accesso all’Opera ovvero l’uso dell’Opera, in maniera
     incompatibile con i termini della presente Licenza. Quanto sopra si
     applica all’Opera anche quando questa faccia parte di una Collezione
     di Opere, anche se ciò non comporta che la Collezione di Opere di
     per sé ed indipendentemente dall’Opera stessa debba essere soggetta
     ai termini ed alle condizioni della presente Licenza. Qualora Tu
     crei una Collezione di Opere, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante,
     devi rimuovere dalla Collezione di Opere stessa, ove materialmente
     possibile, ogni riferimento a tale Licenziante o, su richiesta di
     qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale Autore Originario, come da
     richiesta. Qualora tu crei un’Opera Derivata, su richiesta di
     qualsiasi Licenziante devi rimuovere dall’Opera Derivata stessa,
     nella misura in cui ciò sia possibile, ogni riferimento a tale
     Licenziante o, su richiesta di qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale
     Autore Originario, come da richiesta.
 3.  Qualora Tu distribuisca, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegua,
     reciti o esponga in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, l’Opera o
     qualsiasi Opera Derivata o Collezione di Opere, devi mantenere
     intatte tutte le informative sul diritto d’autore sull’Opera. Devi
     riconoscere all’Autore Originale una menzione adeguata rispetto al
     mezzo di comunicazione o supporto che utilizzi citando il nome (o lo
     pseudonimo, se del caso) dell’Autore Originale, ove fornito; il
     titolo dell’Opera, ove fornito; nella misura in cui sia
     ragionevolmente possibile, l’Uniform Resource Identifier, che il
     Licenziante specifichi dover essere associato con l’Opera, salvo che
     tale URI non faccia riferimento alla informazione di protezione di
     diritto d’autore o non dia informazioni sulla licenza dell’Opera;
     inoltre, in caso di Opera Derivata, devi menzionare l’uso dell’Opera
     nell’Opera Derivata (ad esempio, “traduzione francese dell’Opera
     dell’Autore Originario”, o “sceneggiatura basata sull’Opera
     originaria dell’Autore Originario”). Tale menzione deve essere
     realizzata in qualsiasi maniera ragionevole possibile; in ogni caso,
     in ipotesi di Opera Derivata o Collezione di Opere, tale menzione
     deve quantomeno essere posta nel medesimo punto dove viene indicato
     il nome di altri autori di rilevanza paragonabile e con lo stesso
     risalto concesso alla menzione di altri autori di rilevanza
     paragonabile.
 .
 5. Dichiarazioni, Garanzie ed Esonero da responsabilità
 .
 SALVO CHE SIA ESPRESSAMENTE CONVENUTO ALTRIMENTI PER ISCRITTO FRA LE
 PARTI, IL LICENZIANTE OFFRE L’OPERA IN LICENZA “COSI’ COM’E’” E NON
 FORNISCE ALCUNA DICHIARAZIONE O GARANZIA DI QUALSIASI TIPO CON RIGUARDO
 ALL’OPERA, SIA ESSA ESPRESSA OD IMPLICITA, DI FONTE LEGALE O DI ALTRO
 TIPO, ESSENDO QUINDI ESCLUSE, FRA LE ALTRE, LE GARANZIE RELATIVE AL
 TITOLO, ALLA COMMERCIABILITÀ, ALL’IDONEITÀ PER UN FINE SPECIFICO E ALLA
 NON VIOLAZIONE DI DIRITTI DI TERZI O ALLA MANCANZA DI DIFETTI LATENTI O
 DI ALTRO TIPO, ALL’ESATTEZZA OD ALLA PRESENZA DI ERRORI, SIANO ESSI
 ACCERTABILI O MENO. ALCUNE GIURISDIZIONI NON CONSENTONO L’ESCLUSIONE DI
 GARANZIE IMPLICITE E QUINDI TALE ESCLUSIONE PUÒ NON APPLICARSI A TE.
 .
 6. Limitazione di Responsabilità. SALVI I LIMITI STABILITI DALLA LEGGE
 APPLICABILE, IL LICENZIANTE NON SARÀ IN ALCUN CASO RESPONSABILE NEI TUOI
 CONFRONTI A QUALUNQUE TITOLO PER ALCUN TIPO DI DANNO, SIA ESSO SPECIALE,
 INCIDENTALE, CONSEQUENZIALE, PUNITIVO OD ESEMPLARE, DERIVANTE DALLA
 PRESENTE LICENZA O DALL’USO DELL’OPERA, ANCHE NEL CASO IN CUI IL
 LICENZIANTE SIA STATO EDOTTO SULLA POSSIBILITÀ DI TALI DANNI. NESSUNA
 CLAUSOLA DI QUESTA LICENZA ESCLUDE O LIMITA LA RESPONSABILITA’ NEL CASO
 IN CUI QUESTA DIPENDA DA DOLO O COLPA GRAVE.
 .
 7. Risoluzione
 .
 1.  La presente Licenza si intenderà risolta di diritto e i diritti con
     essa concessi cesseranno automaticamente, senza necessità di alcuna
     comunicazione in tal senso da parte del Licenziante, in caso di
     qualsivoglia inadempimento dei termini della presente Licenza da
     parte Tua, ed in particolare delle disposizioni di cui ai punti 4.a,
     4.b e 4.c, essendo la presente Licenza condizionata risolutivamente
     al verificarsi di tali inadempimenti. In ogni caso, la risoluzione
     della presente Licenza non pregiudicherà i diritti acquistati da
     individui o enti che abbiano acquistato da Te Opere Derivate o
     Collezioni di Opere, ai sensi della presente Licenza, a condizione
     che tali individui o enti continuino a rispettare integralmente le
     licenze di cui sono parte. Le sezioni 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 rimangono
     valide in presenza di qualsiasi risoluzione della presente Licenza.
 2.  Sempre che vengano rispettati i termini e le condizioni di cui
     sopra, la presente Licenza è perpetua (e concessa per tutta la
     durata del diritto d’autore sull’Opera applicabile). Nonostante ciò,
     il Licenziante si riserva il diritto di rilasciare l’Opera sulla
     base dei termini di una differente licenza o di cessare la
     distribuzione dell’Opera in qualsiasi momento; fermo restando che,
     in ogni caso, tali decisioni non comporteranno recesso dalla
     presente Licenza (o da qualsiasi altra licenza che sia stata
     concessa, o che sia richiesto che venga concessa, ai termini della
     presente Licenza), e la presente Licenza continuerà ad avere piena
     efficacia, salvo che vi sia risoluzione come sopra indicato.
 .
 8. Varie
 .
 1.  Ogni volta che Tu distribuisci, o rappresenti, esegui o reciti
     pubblicamente in forma digitale l’Opera o una Collezione di Opere,
     il Licenziante offre al destinatario una licenza per l’Opera nei
     medesimi termini e condizioni che a Te sono stati concessi dalla
     presente Licenza.
 2.  Ogni volta che Tu distribuisci, o rappresenti, esegui o reciti
     pubblicamente in forma digitale un’Opera Derivata, il Licenziante
     offre al destinatario una licenza per l’Opera originale nei medesimi
     termini e condizioni che a Te sono stati concessi dalla presente
     Licenza.
 3.  L’invalidità o l’inefficacia, secondo la legge applicabile, di una o
     più fra le disposizioni della presente Licenza, non comporterà
     l’invalidità o l’inefficacia dei restanti termini e, senza bisogno
     di ulteriori azioni delle parti, le disposizioni invalide od
     inefficaci saranno da intendersi rettificate nei limiti della misura
     che sia indispensabile per renderle valide ed efficaci.
 4.  In nessun caso i termini e le disposizioni di cui alla presente
     Licenza possono essere considerati rinunciati, né alcuna violazione
     può essere considerata consentita, salvo che tale rinuncia o
     consenso risultino per iscritto da una dichiarazione firmata dalla
     parte contro cui operi tale rinuncia o consenso.
 5.  La presente Licenza costituisce l’intero accordo tra le parti
     relativamente all’Opera qui data in licenza. Non esistono altre
     intese, accordi o dichiarazioni relative all’Opera che non siano
     quelle qui specificate. Il Licenziante non sarà vincolato ad alcuna
     altra disposizione addizionale che possa apparire in alcuna
     comunicazione da Te proveniente. La presente Licenza non può essere
     modificata senza il mutuo consenso scritto del Licenziante e Tuo.
 6.  Clausola iCommons. Questa Licenza trova applicazione nel caso in cui
     l’Opera sia utilizzata in Italia. Ove questo sia il caso, si applica
     anche il diritto d’autore italiano. Negli altri casi le parti si
     obbligano a rispettare i termini dell’attuale Licenza Creative
     Commons generica che corrisponde a questa Licenza Creative Commons
     iCommons.
 .
 Creative Commons non è parte della presente Licenza e non dà alcuna
 garanzia connessa all’Opera. Creative Commons non è responsabile nei
 Tuoi confronti o nei confronti di altre parti ad alcun titolo per alcun
 danno, incluso, senza limitazioni, qualsiasi danno generale. speciale,
 incidentale o consequenziale che sorga in connessione alla presente
 Licenza. Nonostante quanto previsto nelle due precedenti frasi, qualora
 Creative Commons espressamente identificasse se stesso quale Licenziante
 nei termini di cui al presente accordo, avrà tutti i diritti e tutti gli
 obblighi del Licenziante.
 .
 Salvo che per il solo scopo di indicare al pubblico che l’Opera è data
 in licenza secondo i termini della CCPL, nessuna parte potrà utilizzare
 il marchio “Creative Commons” o qualsiasi altro marchio correlato, o il
 logo di Creative Commons, senza il preventivo consenso scritto di
 Creative Commons. Ogni uso consentito sarà realizzato con l’osservanza
 delle linee guida per l’uso del marchio Creative Commons, in forza in
 quel momento, come di volta in volta pubblicate sul sito Internet di
 Creative Commons o altrimenti messe a disposizione a richiesta.

 1. Definitions
 .
 1.  "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
     other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
     derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
     literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
     cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
     be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
     recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
     constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
     the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
     Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
     synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
     ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
     this License.
 2.  "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
     as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
     broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
     in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
     arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
     which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
     with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
     collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
     considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
     License.
 3.  "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed
     at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
     approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
     License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
     terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
     Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
     relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that

 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 1.  to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collections;
 2.  to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
     Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
     reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
     translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
     English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
     work has been modified.";
 3.  to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
     incorporated in Collections; and,
 4.  to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
 5.  For the avoidance of doubt:
 .
     1.  Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
         in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
         reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
         exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
     2.  Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
         which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
         compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
         by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
     3.  Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
         the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
         any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 1.  You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
     of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
     Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
     terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
     ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
     to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
     sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
     this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
     the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
     Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
     technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
     recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
     that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
     applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
     not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
     subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
     upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
     remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c),
     as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
 2.  You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
     terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License
     with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative
     Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
     version) that contains the same License Elements as this License
     (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
     Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the
     licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
     license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the
     licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
     you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally
     and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the
     URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation
     You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose
     any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the
     Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
     to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
     the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
     refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
     with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly
     Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
     technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability
     of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights
     granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
     This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
     Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the
     Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
     License.
 3.  If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
     or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
     Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
     provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
     the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
     supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
     another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
     entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
     Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
     means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
     if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
     any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
     such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
     information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
     in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
     Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
     Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
     Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
     implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
     case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
     appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
     or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
     at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
     authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
     required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
     manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
     License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
     connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
     Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
     use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
     permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
     Parties.
 4.  Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
     otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
     or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
     Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
     or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
     be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
     Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
     any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
     (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
     mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
     the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
     or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
     permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
     reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
     (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS,
 WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE
 EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
     from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
     terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
     compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
     survive any termination of this License.
 2.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
     of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
     effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 1.  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
     Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
 2.  Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
     offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
     terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
     License.
 3.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
 4.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
 5.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
     You.
 6.  The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
     License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
     Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
     amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
     WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
     Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
     July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
     relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
     enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
     implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
     law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
     copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
     License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
     License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
     rights under applicable law.

 Creative Commons Corporation ("Creative Commons") is not a law firm and

 Using Creative Commons Public Licenses
 .
 Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
 conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
 original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright
 and certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
 following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
 exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.
 .
      Considerations for licensors: Our public licenses are
      intended for use by those authorized to give the public
      permission to use material in ways otherwise restricted by
      copyright and certain other rights. Our licenses are
      irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the terms
      and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
      Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before
      applying our licenses so that the public can reuse the
      material as expected. Licensors should clearly mark any
      material not subject to the license. This includes other CC-
      licensed material, or material used under an exception or
      limitation to copyright. More considerations for licensors:
 	wiki.creativecommons.org/Considerations_for_licensors
 .
      Considerations for the public: By using one of our public
      licenses, a licensor grants the public permission to use the
      licensed material under specified terms and conditions. If
      the licensor's permission is not necessary for any reason--for
      example, because of any applicable exception or limitation to
      copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our
      licenses grant only permissions under copyright and certain
      other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use of
      the licensed material may still be restricted for other
      reasons, including because others have copyright or other
      rights in the material. A licensor may make special requests,
      such as asking that all changes be marked or described.
      Although not required by our licenses, you are encouraged to
      respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations

 Section 2 -- Scope.
 .
   a. License grant.
 .
        1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
           the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
           non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
           exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
 .
             a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                in part; and
 .
             b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
 .
        2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
           Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
           License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
           its terms and conditions.
 .
        3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
           6(a).
 .
        4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
           Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
           all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
           and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
           Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
           authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
           necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
           technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
           Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
           simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
           (4) never produces Adapted Material.
 .
        5. Downstream recipients.
 .
             a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                Public License.
 .
             b. Additional offer from the Licensor -- Adapted Material.
                Every recipient of Adapted Material from You
                automatically receives an offer from the Licensor to
                exercise the Licensed Rights in the Adapted Material
                under the conditions of the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
             c. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                Material.
 .
        6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
           may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
           are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
           with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
           the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
           provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
 .
   b. Other rights.
 .
        1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
           licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
           privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
           the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
           assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
           extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
           Rights, but not otherwise.
 .
        2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
           Public License.
 .
        3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
           collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
           Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
           under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
           licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
           reserves any right to collect such royalties.
 .
 .
 Section 3 -- License Conditions.
 .
 Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
 following conditions.
 .
   a. Attribution.
 .
        1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
           form), You must:
 .
             a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                with the Licensed Material:
 .
                  i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                     Material and any others designated to receive
                     attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                     the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                     designated);
 .
                 ii. a copyright notice;
 .
                iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
 .
                 iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                     warranties;
 .
                  v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                     extent reasonably practicable;
 .
             b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
 .
             c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                hyperlink to, this Public License.
 .
        2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
           reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
           which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
           reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
           hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
           information.
 .
        3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
           information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
           reasonably practicable.
 .
   b. ShareAlike.
 .
      In addition to the conditions in Section 3(a), if You Share
      Adapted Material You produce, the following conditions also apply.
 .
        1. The Adapter's License You apply must be a Creative Commons
           license with the same License Elements, this version or
           later, or a BY-SA Compatible License.
 .
        2. You must include the text of, or the URI or hyperlink to, the
           Adapter's License You apply. You may satisfy this condition
           in any reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and
           context in which You Share Adapted Material.
 .
        3. You may not offer or impose any additional or different terms
           or conditions on, or apply any Effective Technological
           Measures to, Adapted Material that restrict exercise of the
           rights granted under the Adapter's License You apply.
 .
 .
 Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
 .
 Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
 apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
 .
   a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
      to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
      portion of the contents of the database;
 .
   b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
      contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
      Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material,
 .
      including for purposes of Section 3(b); and
   c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
      all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
 .
 For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
 replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
 Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.
 .
 .
 Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
 .
   a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
      EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
      AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
      ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
      IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
      PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
      ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
      KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
      ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
      TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
      NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
      COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
      USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
      ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
      DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
      IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
   c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
      above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
      possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
      waiver of all liability.
 .
 .
 Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
 .
   a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
      Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
      this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
      terminate automatically.
 .
   b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
      Section 6(a), it reinstates:
 .
        1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
           it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
           violation; or
 .
        2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
 .
      For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
      right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
      of this Public License.
 .
   c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
      Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
      distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
      will not terminate this Public License.
 .
   d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
      License.
 .
 .
 Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
 .
   a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
      terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
 .
   b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
      Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
      independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.
 .
 .
 Section 8 -- Interpretation.
 .
   a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
      shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
      conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
      be made without permission under this Public License.
 .
   b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
      deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
      minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
      cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
      without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
      conditions.
 .
   c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
      failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
      Licensor.
 .
   d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
      as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
      that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
      processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

   ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
   INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES

 License
 .
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE
 COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY
 COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS
 AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE
 TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY
 BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS
 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 1.  "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
     unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined
     below) for the purposes of this License.
 2.  "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
     and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
     arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
     version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
     condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
     transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
     purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
     is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
     the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
     considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
 3.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
     that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
 4.  "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or
     entities who created the Work.
 5.  "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
     terms of this License.
 6.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
 limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 1.  to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collective Works;
 2.  to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
     Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes
     reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
     translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
     English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
     work has been modified.";;
 3.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
 4.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission Derivative Works.
 5.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
 .
     1.  Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the
         event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society
         (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the
         public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
         of the Work.
     2.  Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
         rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
         royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover
         version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
         created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
         equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 6.  Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
     doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
     exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
     performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
     public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
     the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
     Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
 are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 1.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and
     You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
     this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
     that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
     and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work,
     You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that
     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
     the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the License.
     This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
     Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
     from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
     License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
     requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(b), as
     requested.
 2.  If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
     Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works
     (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been
     made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
     the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
     utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
     applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
     Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
     other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title
     of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the
     Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
     associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
     copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and,
     consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a
     credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
     "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
     this Section 4(b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
     Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
     for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective
     Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
     as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For
     the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
     Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
     implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
     sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
     without the separate, express prior written permission of the
     Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE
 LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
 OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
 MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
 THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
 JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works (as
     defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works (as defined in
     Section 1 above) from You under this License, however, will not have
     their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
     remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
     7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 2.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
     of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
     effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 1.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
     defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in
     Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
     the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
     You under this License.
 2.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
     Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
 3.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
 4.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
 5.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
     You.
 .
   Creative Commons Notice
 .
   Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no warranty

   liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any damages
   whatsoever, including without limitation any general, special,
   incidental or consequential damages arising in connection to this
   license. Notwithstanding the foregoing two (2) sentences, if Creative
   Commons has expressly identified itself as the Licensor hereunder, it
   shall have all rights and obligations of Licensor.

 CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND
 CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions
 .
 1.  "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
     anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
     unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions,
     constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
     assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined
     below) for the purposes of this License.
 2.  "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed
     at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
     approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
     License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
     terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
     Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
     relicensing of derivatives of works made available under that
     license under this License or either a Creative Commons unported
     license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license with the same
     License Elements as this License.
 3.  "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
     and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
     arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture
     version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
     condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
     transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
     Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
     purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work
     is a musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of
     the Work in timed-relation with a moving image ("synching") will be
     considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License.
 4.  "License Elements" means the following high-level license attributes
     as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this License:
     Attribution, ShareAlike.
 5.  "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
     that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
 6.  "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or
     entities who created the Work.
 7.  "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the
     terms of this License.
 8.  "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
     License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
     with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
     from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
     previous violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first sale or other
 limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright owner under
 copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 1.  to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
     Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
     Collective Works;
 2.  to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
     Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes
     reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
     that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
     translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
     English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
     work has been modified.";
 3.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
 4.  to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
     publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
     transmission Derivative Works.
 5.  For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition:
 .
     1.  Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives
         the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the
         event that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society
         (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the
         public performance or public digital performance (e.g. webcast)
         of the Work.
     2.  Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
         exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
         rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
         royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover
         version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
         created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
         equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 6.  Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
     doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
     exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
     performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
     public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
     the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
     Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by Licensor
 are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 1.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and
     You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
     this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
     distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work
     that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a
     recipient of the Work to exercise of the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the License. You may not sublicense the
     Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to this License
     and to the disclaimer of warranties. When You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work,
     You may not impose any technological measures on the Work that
     restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to exercise
     of the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
     License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a
     Collective Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart
     from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
     License. If You create a Collective Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Collective Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
     requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon notice from any
     Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
     Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
     requested.
 2.  You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform a Derivative Work only under: (i) the terms of
     this License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same
     License Elements as this License; (iii) either the Creative Commons
     (Unported) license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license
     (either this or a later license version) that contains the same
     License Elements as this License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0
     (Unported)); (iv) a Creative Commons Compatible License. If you
     license the Derivative Work under one of the licenses mentioned in
     (iv), you must comply with the terms of that license. If you license
     the Derivative Work under the terms of any of the licenses mentioned
     in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"), you must comply
     with the terms of the Applicable License generally and with the
     following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the Uniform
     Resource Identifier for, the Applicable License with every copy or
     phonorecord of each Derivative Work You distribute, publicly
     display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform; (II) You
     may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative Works that
     restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability of a
     recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must
     keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to
     the disclaimer of warranties; and, (IV) when You distribute,
     publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform
     the Work, You may not impose any technological measures on the
     Derivative Work that restrict the ability of a recipient of the
     Derivative Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that
     recipient under the terms of the Applicable License. This Section
     4(b) applies to the Derivative Work as incorporated in a Collective
     Work, but this does not require the Collective Work apart from the
     Derivative Work itself to be made subject to the terms of the
     Applicable License.
 3.  If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
     digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
     Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works
     (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been
     made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
     the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
     utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
     applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
     Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor
     institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution
     Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by
     other reasonable means, the name of such party or parties; the title
     of the Work if supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the
     Uniform Resource Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be
     associated with the Work, unless such URI does not refer to the
     copyright notice or licensing information for the Work; and,
     consistent with Section 3(b) in the case of a Derivative Work, a
     credit identifying the use of the Work in the Derivative Work (e.g.,
     "French translation of the Work by Original Author," or "Screenplay
     based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit required by
     this Section 4(c) may be implemented in any reasonable manner;
     provided, however, that in the case of a Derivative Work or
     Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear, if a credit
     for all contributing authors of the Derivative Work or Collective
     Work appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner at least
     as prominent as the credits for the other contributing authors. For
     the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit required by this
     Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above
     and, by exercising Your rights under this License, You may not
     implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any connection with,
     sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor and/or
     Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work,
     without the separate, express prior written permission of the
     Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS HELD IN THE
 LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
 WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY
 OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
 MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
 NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR
 THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME
 JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
 EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS
 BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
 1.  This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
     automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
     Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
     Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
     their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities
     remain in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6,
     7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
 2.  Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
     is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
     Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
     release the Work under different license terms or to stop
     distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
     election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
     license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
     of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
     effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
 1.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
     defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in
     Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
     the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
     You under this License.
 2.  Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
     Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original
     Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
     under this License.
 3.  If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
     applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
     of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
     action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
     reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
     valid and enforceable.
 4.  No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
     breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
     writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
     consent.
 5.  This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
     with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
     agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
     here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
     may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
     modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
     You.

 La Licenza
 .
 L’OPERA (COME SOTTO DEFINITA) È MESSA A DISPOSIZIONE SULLA BASE DEI
 TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA “CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENCE” (‘CCPL’
 O ‘LICENZA’). L’OPERA E’ PROTETTA DAL DIRITTO D’AUTORE E/O DALLE ALTRE
 LEGGI APPLICABILI. OGNI UTILIZZAZIONE DELL’OPERA CHE NON SIA AUTORIZZATA
 AI SENSI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA O DEL DIRITTO D’AUTORE È PROIBITA.
 .
 CON IL SEMPLICE ESERCIZIO SULL’OPERA DI UNO QUALUNQUE DEI DIRITTI QUI DI
 SEGUITO ELENCATI, TU ACCETTI E TI OBBLIGHI A RISPETTARE INTEGRALMENTE I
 TERMINI DELLA PRESENTE LICENZA AI SENSI DEL PUNTO 8.f. IL LICENZIANTE
 CONCEDE A TE I DIRITTI QUI DI SEGUITO ELENCATI A CONDIZIONE CHE TU

 1. Definizioni. Ai fini e per gli effetti della presente licenza, si
 intende per
 .
 1.  "Collezione di Opere", un’opera, come un numero di un periodico,
     un’antologia o un’enciclopedia, nella quale l’Opera nella sua
     interezza e forma originale, unitamente ad altri contributi
     costituenti loro stessi opere distinte ed autonome, sono raccolti in
     un’unità collettiva. Un’opera che costituisce Collezione di Opere
     non verrà considerata Opera Derivata (come sotto definita) ai fini
     della presente Licenza;
 2.  "Opera Derivata", un’opera basata sull’Opera ovvero sull’Opera
     insieme con altre opere preesistenti, come una traduzione, un
     arrangiamento musicale, un adattamento teatrale, narrativo,
     cinematografico, una registrazione di suoni, una riproduzione
     d’arte, un digesto, una sintesi, od ogni altra forma in cui l’Opera
     possa essere riproposta, trasformata o adattata. Nel caso in cui
     un’Opera tra quelle qui descritte costituisca già Collezione di
     Opere, essa non sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini della
     presente Licenza. Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, quando
     l’Opera sia una composizione musicale o registrazione di suoni, la
     sincronizzazione dell’Opera in relazione con un’immagine in
     movimento (“synching”) sarà considerata Opera Derivata ai fini di
     questa Licenza;
 3.  "Licenziante", l’individuo o l’ente che offre l’Opera secondo i
     termini e le condizioni della presente Licenza;
 4.  "Autore Originario", il soggetto che ha creato l’Opera;
 5.  "Opera", l’opera dell’ingegno suscettibile di protezione in forza
     delle leggi sul diritto d’autore, la cui utilizzazione è offerta nel
     rispetto dei termini della presente Licenza;
 6.  "Tu"/"Te", l’individuo o l’ente che esercita i diritti derivanti
     dalla presente Licenza e che non abbia precedentemente violato i
     termini della presente Licenza relativi all’Opera, o che, nonostante
     una precedente violazione degli stessi, abbia ricevuto espressa
     autorizzazione dal Licenziante all’esercizio dei diritti derivanti
     dalla presente Licenza;
 7.  "Elementi della Licenza", gli attributi fondamentali della Licenza
     scelti dal Licenziante ed indicati nel titolo della Licenza:
     Attribuzione, Condividi allo stesso modo.
 .
 2. Libere utilizzazioni. La presente Licenza non intende in alcun modo
 ridurre, limitare o restringere alcun diritto di libera utilizzazione o
 l’operare della regola dell’esaurimento del diritto o altre limitazioni
 dei diritti esclusivi sull’Opera derivanti dalla legge sul diritto
 d’autore o da altre leggi applicabili.
 .
 3. Concessione della Licenza. Nel rispetto dei termini e delle
 condizioni contenute nella presente Licenza, il Licenziante concede a Te
 una licenza per tutto il mondo, gratuita, non esclusiva e perpetua (per
 la durata del diritto d’autore applicabile) che autorizza ad esercitare
 i diritti sull’Opera qui di seguito elencati:
 .
 1.  riproduzione dell’Opera, incorporazione dell’Opera in una o più
     Collezioni di Opere e riproduzione dell’Opera come incorporata nelle
     Collezioni di Opere;
 2.  creazione e riproduzione di un’Opera Derivata;
 3.  distribuzione di copie dell’Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui
     l’Opera è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico, rappresentazione,
     esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico, ivi inclusa la
     trasmissione audio digitale dell’Opera, e ciò anche quando l’Opera
     sia incorporata in Collezioni di Opere;
 4.  distribuzione di copie dell’Opera o di supporti fonografici su cui
     l’Opera Derivata è registrata, comunicazione al pubblico,
     rappresentazione, esecuzione, recitazione o esposizione in pubblico,
     ivi inclusa la trasmissione audio digitale di Opere Derivate.
 5.  Al fine di evitare dubbi è inteso che, se l’Opera sia di tipo
     musicale
 .
     1.  Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico o la rappresentazione
         od esecuzione di opere incluse in repertori. Il Licenziante
         rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di riscuotere compensi,
         personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di gestione collettiva
         (ad es. SIAE), per la comunicazione al pubblico o la
         rappresentazione od esecuzione, anche in forma digitale (ad es.
         tramite webcast) dell’Opera.
     2.  Compensi per versioni cover. Il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto
         esclusivo di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite
         di un ente di gestione collettiva (ad es. SIAE), per ogni disco
         che Tu crei e distribuisci a partire dall’Opera (versione
         cover).
 .
 6.  Compensi per la comunicazione al pubblico dell’Opera mediante
     fonogrammi. Al fine di evitare dubbi, è inteso che se l’Opera è una
     registrazione di suoni, il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo
     di riscuotere compensi, personalmente o per il tramite di un ente di
     gestione collettiva (ad es. IMAIE), per la comunicazione al pubblico
     dell’Opera, anche in forma digitale.
 7.  Altri compensi previsti dalla legge italiana. Al fine di evitare
     dubbi, è inteso che il Licenziante rinuncia al diritto esclusivo di
     riscuotere i compensi a lui attribuiti dalla legge italiana sul
     diritto d’autore (ad es. per l’inserimento dell’Opera in
     un’antologia ad uso scolastico ex art. 70 l. 633/1941). Al
     Licenziante spettano in ogni caso i compensi irrinunciabili a lui
     attribuiti dalla medesima legge (ad es. l’equo compenso spettante
     all’autore di opere musicali, cinematografiche, audiovisive o di
     sequenze di immagini in movimento nel caso di noleggio ai sensi
     dell’art. 18-bis l. 633/1941).
 .
 I diritti sopra descritti potranno essere esercitati con ogni mezzo di
 comunicazione e in tutti i formati. Tra i diritti di cui sopra si
 intende compreso il diritto di apportare all’Opera le modifiche che si
 rendessero tecnicamente necessarie per l’esercizio di detti diritti
 tramite altri mezzi di comunicazione o su altri formati. Tutti i diritti
 non espressamente concessi dal Licenziante rimangono riservati.
 .
 4. Restrizioni. La Licenza concessa in conformità al precedente punto 3
 è espressamente assoggettata a, e limitata da, le seguenti restrizioni
 .
 1.  Tu puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare,
     eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera, anche in forma
     digitale, solo assicurando che i termini di cui alla presente
     Licenza siano rispettati e, insieme ad ogni copia dell’Opera (o
     supporto fonografico su cui è registrata l’Opera) che distribuisci,
     comunichi al pubblico o rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in
     pubblico, anche in forma digitale, devi includere una copia della
     presente Licenza o il suo Uniform Resource Identifier. Non puoi
     proporre od imporre alcuna condizione relativa all’Opera che alteri
     o restringa i termini della presente Licenza o l’esercizio da parte
     del beneficiario dei diritti qui concessi. Non puoi concedere
     l’Opera in sublicenza. Devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative
     che si riferiscono alla presente Licenza ed all’esclusione delle
     garanzie. Non puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico,
     rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera,
     neanche in forma digitale, usando misure tecnologiche miranti a
     controllare l’accesso all’Opera ovvero l’uso dell’Opera, in maniera
     incompatibile con i termini della presente Licenza. Quanto sopra si
     applica all’Opera anche quando questa faccia parte di una Collezione
     di Opere, anche se ciò non comporta che la Collezione di Opere di
     per sé ed indipendentemente dall’Opera stessa debba essere soggetta
     ai termini ed alle condizioni della presente Licenza. Qualora Tu
     crei una Collezione di Opere, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante,
     devi rimuovere dalla Collezione di Opere stessa, ove materialmente
     possibile, ogni riferimento a tale Licenziante o, su richiesta di
     qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale Autore Originario, come da
     richiesta. Qualora tu crei un’Opera Derivata, su richiesta di
     qualsiasi Licenziante devi rimuovere dall’Opera Derivata stessa,
     nella misura in cui ciò sia possibile, ogni riferimento a tale
     Licenziante o, su richiesta di qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale
     Autore Originario, come da richiesta.
 2.  Tu puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico, rappresentare,
     eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera, anche in forma
     digitale, solo assicurando che i termini di cui alla presente
     Licenza siano rispettati e, insieme ad ogni copia dell’Opera (o
     supporto fonografico su cui è registrata l’Opera) che distribuisci,
     comunichi al pubblico o rappresenti, esegui, reciti o esponi in
     pubblico, anche in forma digitale, devi includere una copia della
     presente Licenza o il suo Uniform Resource Identifier. Non puoi
     proporre od imporre alcuna condizione relativa all’Opera che alteri
     o restringa i termini della presente Licenza o l’esercizio da parte
     del beneficiario dei diritti qui concessi. Non puoi concedere
     l’Opera in sublicenza. Devi mantenere intatte tutte le informative
     che si riferiscono alla presente Licenza ed all’esclusione delle
     garanzie. Non puoi distribuire, comunicare al pubblico,
     rappresentare, eseguire, recitare o esporre in pubblico l’Opera,
     neanche in forma digitale, usando misure tecnologiche miranti a
     controllare l’accesso all’Opera ovvero l’uso dell’Opera, in maniera
     incompatibile con i termini della presente Licenza. Quanto sopra si
     applica all’Opera anche quando questa faccia parte di una Collezione
     di Opere, anche se ciò non comporta che la Collezione di Opere di
     per sé ed indipendentemente dall’Opera stessa debba essere soggetta
     ai termini ed alle condizioni della presente Licenza. Qualora Tu
     crei una Collezione di Opere, su richiesta di qualsiasi Licenziante,
     devi rimuovere dalla Collezione di Opere stessa, ove materialmente
     possibile, ogni riferimento a tale Licenziante o, su richiesta di
     qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale Autore Originario, come da
     richiesta. Qualora tu crei un’Opera Derivata, su richiesta di
     qualsiasi Licenziante devi rimuovere dall’Opera Derivata stessa,
     nella misura in cui ciò sia possibile, ogni riferimento a tale
     Licenziante o, su richiesta di qualsiasi Autore Originario, a tale
     Autore Originario, come da richiesta.
 3.  Qualora Tu distribuisca, comunichi al pubblico, rappresenti, esegua,
     reciti o esponga in pubblico, anche in forma digitale, l’Opera o
     qualsiasi Opera Derivata o Collezione di Opere, devi mantenere
     intatte tutte le informative sul diritto d’autore sull’Opera. Devi
     riconoscere all’Autore Originale una menzione adeguata rispetto al
     mezzo di comunicazione o supporto che utilizzi citando il nome (o lo
     pseudonimo, se del caso) dell’Autore Originale, ove fornito; il
     titolo dell’Opera, ove fornito; nella misura in cui sia
     ragionevolmente possibile, l’Uniform Resource Identifier, che il
     Licenziante specifichi dover essere associato con l’Opera, salvo che
     tale URI non faccia riferimento alla informazione di protezione di
     diritto d’autore o non dia informazioni sulla licenza dell’Opera;
     inoltre, in caso di Opera Derivata, devi menzionare l’uso dell’Opera
     nell’Opera Derivata (ad esempio, “traduzione francese dell’Opera
     dell’Autore Originario”, o “sceneggiatura basata sull’Opera
     originaria dell’Autore Originario”). Tale menzione deve essere
     realizzata in qualsiasi maniera ragionevole possibile; in ogni caso,
     in ipotesi di Opera Derivata o Collezione di Opere, tale menzione
     deve quantomeno essere posta nel medesimo punto dove viene indicato
     il nome di altri autori di rilevanza paragonabile e con lo stesso
     risalto concesso alla menzione di altri autori di rilevanza
     paragonabile.
 .
 5. Dichiarazioni, Garanzie ed Esonero da responsabilità
 .
 SALVO CHE SIA ESPRESSAMENTE CONVENUTO ALTRIMENTI PER ISCRITTO FRA LE
 PARTI, IL LICENZIANTE OFFRE L’OPERA IN LICENZA “COSI’ COM’E’” E NON
 FORNISCE ALCUNA DICHIARAZIONE O GARANZIA DI QUALSIASI TIPO CON RIGUARDO
 ALL’OPERA, SIA ESSA ESPRESSA OD IMPLICITA, DI FONTE LEGALE O DI ALTRO
 TIPO, ESSENDO QUINDI ESCLUSE, FRA LE ALTRE, LE GARANZIE RELATIVE AL
 TITOLO, ALLA COMMERCIABILITÀ, ALL’IDONEITÀ PER UN FINE SPECIFICO E ALLA
 NON VIOLAZIONE DI DIRITTI DI TERZI O ALLA MANCANZA DI DIFETTI LATENTI O
 DI ALTRO TIPO, ALL’ESATTEZZA OD ALLA PRESENZA DI ERRORI, SIANO ESSI
 ACCERTABILI O MENO. ALCUNE GIURISDIZIONI NON CONSENTONO L’ESCLUSIONE DI
 GARANZIE IMPLICITE E QUINDI TALE ESCLUSIONE PUÒ NON APPLICARSI A TE.
 .
 6. Limitazione di Responsabilità. SALVI I LIMITI STABILITI DALLA LEGGE
 APPLICABILE, IL LICENZIANTE NON SARÀ IN ALCUN CASO RESPONSABILE NEI TUOI
 CONFRONTI A QUALUNQUE TITOLO PER ALCUN TIPO DI DANNO, SIA ESSO SPECIALE,
 INCIDENTALE, CONSEQUENZIALE, PUNITIVO OD ESEMPLARE, DERIVANTE DALLA
 PRESENTE LICENZA O DALL’USO DELL’OPERA, ANCHE NEL CASO IN CUI IL
 LICENZIANTE SIA STATO EDOTTO SULLA POSSIBILITÀ DI TALI DANNI. NESSUNA
 CLAUSOLA DI QUESTA LICENZA ESCLUDE O LIMITA LA RESPONSABILITA’ NEL CASO
 IN CUI QUESTA DIPENDA DA DOLO O COLPA GRAVE.
 .
 7. Risoluzione
 .
 1.  La presente Licenza si intenderà risolta di diritto e i diritti con
     essa concessi cesseranno automaticamente, senza necessità di alcuna
     comunicazione in tal senso da parte del Licenziante, in caso di
     qualsivoglia inadempimento dei termini della presente Licenza da
     parte Tua, ed in particolare delle disposizioni di cui ai punti 4.a,
     4.b e 4.c, essendo la presente Licenza condizionata risolutivamente
     al verificarsi di tali inadempimenti. In ogni caso, la risoluzione
     della presente Licenza non pregiudicherà i diritti acquistati da
     individui o enti che abbiano acquistato da Te Opere Derivate o
     Collezioni di Opere, ai sensi della presente Licenza, a condizione
     che tali individui o enti continuino a rispettare integralmente le
     licenze di cui sono parte. Le sezioni 1, 2, 5, 6, 7 e 8 rimangono
     valide in presenza di qualsiasi risoluzione della presente Licenza.
 2.  Sempre che vengano rispettati i termini e le condizioni di cui
     sopra, la presente Licenza è perpetua (e concessa per tutta la
     durata del diritto d’autore sull’Opera applicabile). Nonostante ciò,
     il Licenziante si riserva il diritto di rilasciare l’Opera sulla
     base dei termini di una differente licenza o di cessare la
     distribuzione dell’Opera in qualsiasi momento; fermo restando che,
     in ogni caso, tali decisioni non comporteranno recesso dalla
     presente Licenza (o da qualsiasi altra licenza che sia stata
     concessa, o che sia richiesto che venga concessa, ai termini della
     presente Licenza), e la presente Licenza continuerà ad avere piena
     efficacia, salvo che vi sia risoluzione come sopra indicato.
 .
 8. Varie
 .
 1.  Ogni volta che Tu distribuisci, o rappresenti, esegui o reciti
     pubblicamente in forma digitale l’Opera o una Collezione di Opere,
     il Licenziante offre al destinatario una licenza per l’Opera nei
     medesimi termini e condizioni che a Te sono stati concessi dalla
     presente Licenza.
 2.  Ogni volta che Tu distribuisci, o rappresenti, esegui o reciti
     pubblicamente in forma digitale un’Opera Derivata, il Licenziante
     offre al destinatario una licenza per l’Opera originale nei medesimi
     termini e condizioni che a Te sono stati concessi dalla presente
     Licenza.
 3.  L’invalidità o l’inefficacia, secondo la legge applicabile, di una o
     più fra le disposizioni della presente Licenza, non comporterà
     l’invalidità o l’inefficacia dei restanti termini e, senza bisogno
     di ulteriori azioni delle parti, le disposizioni invalide od
     inefficaci saranno da intendersi rettificate nei limiti della misura
     che sia indispensabile per renderle valide ed efficaci.
 4.  In nessun caso i termini e le disposizioni di cui alla presente
     Licenza possono essere considerati rinunciati, né alcuna violazione
     può essere considerata consentita, salvo che tale rinuncia o
     consenso risultino per iscritto da una dichiarazione firmata dalla
     parte contro cui operi tale rinuncia o consenso.
 5.  La presente Licenza costituisce l’intero accordo tra le parti
     relativamente all’Opera qui data in licenza. Non esistono altre
     intese, accordi o dichiarazioni relative all’Opera che non siano
     quelle qui specificate. Il Licenziante non sarà vincolato ad alcuna
     altra disposizione addizionale che possa apparire in alcuna
     comunicazione da Te proveniente. La presente Licenza non può essere
     modificata senza il mutuo consenso scritto del Licenziante e Tuo.
 6.  Clausola iCommons. Questa Licenza trova applicazione nel caso in cui
     l’Opera sia utilizzata in Italia. Ove questo sia il caso, si applica
     anche il diritto d’autore italiano. Negli altri casi le parti si
     obbligano a rispettare i termini dell’attuale Licenza Creative
     Commons generica che corrisponde a questa Licenza Creative Commons
     iCommons.
 .
 Creative Commons non è parte della presente Licenza e non dà alcuna
 garanzia connessa all’Opera. Creative Commons non è responsabile nei
 Tuoi confronti o nei confronti di altre parti ad alcun titolo per alcun
 danno, incluso, senza limitazioni, qualsiasi danno generale. speciale,
 incidentale o consequenziale che sorga in connessione alla presente
 Licenza. Nonostante quanto previsto nelle due precedenti frasi, qualora
 Creative Commons espressamente identificasse se stesso quale Licenziante
 nei termini di cui al presente accordo, avrà tutti i diritti e tutti gli
 obblighi del Licenziante.
 .
 Salvo che per il solo scopo di indicare al pubblico che l’Opera è data
 in licenza secondo i termini della CCPL, nessuna parte potrà utilizzare
 il marchio “Creative Commons” o qualsiasi altro marchio correlato, o il
 logo di Creative Commons, senza il preventivo consenso scritto di
 Creative Commons. Ogni uso consentito sarà realizzato con l’osservanza
 delle linee guida per l’uso del marchio Creative Commons, in forza in
 quel momento, come di volta in volta pubblicate sul sito Internet di
 Creative Commons o altrimenti messe a disposizione a richiesta.

 redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
 fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
 redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
 names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
 however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
 requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply to
 any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.

This package was debianized by Brian Nelson <nelson@bignachos.com> on
Sat, 19 Oct 2002 01:23:43 -0700.

It was downloaded from ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/aspell

The upstream author is Kevin Atkinson <kevina@gnu.org>.

Copyright:

This English word list is comes directly from SCOWL 2016.11.20 (up to level 60,
using the speller/make-aspell-dict script, http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/)
and is thus under the same copyright of SCOWL.  The affix file (only
included in the aspell6 package) is based on the Ispell one which is
under the same copyright of Ispell.  Part of SCOWL is also based on
Ispell thus the Ispell copyright is included with the SCOWL copyright.
The collective work is Copyright 2000-2016 by Kevin Atkinson as well
as any of the copyrights mentioned below:

  Copyright 2000-2018 by Kevin Atkinson

  Permission to use, copy, modify, distribute and sell these word
  lists, the associated scripts, the output created from the scripts,
  and its documentation for any purpose is hereby granted without fee,
  provided that the above copyright notice appears in all copies and
  that both that copyright notice and this permission notice appear in
  supporting documentation. Kevin Atkinson makes no representations
  about the suitability of this array for any purpose. It is provided
  "as is" without express or implied warranty.

Alan Beale <biljir@pobox.com> also deserves special credit as he has,
in addition to providing the 12Dicts package and being a major
contributor to the ENABLE word list, given me an incredible amount of
feedback and created a number of special lists (those found in the
Supplement) in order to help improve the overall quality of SCOWL.

The 10 level includes the 1000 most common English words (according to
the Moby (TM) Words II [MWords] package), a subset of the 1000 most
common words on the Internet (again, according to Moby Words II), and
frequently class 16 from Brian Kelk's "UK English Wordlist
with Frequency Classification".

The MWords package was explicitly placed in the public domain:

    The Moby lexicon project is complete and has
    been place into the public domain. Use, sell,
    rework, excerpt and use in any way on any platform.

    Placing this material on internal or public servers is
    also encouraged. The compiler is not aware of any
    export restrictions so freely distribute world-wide.

    You can verify the public domain status by contacting

    Grady Ward
    3449 Martha Ct.
    Arcata, CA  95521-4884

    grady@netcom.com
    grady@northcoast.com

The "UK English Wordlist With Frequency Classification" is also in the
Public Domain:

  Date: Sat, 08 Jul 2000 20:27:21 +0100
  From: Brian Kelk <Brian.Kelk@cl.cam.ac.uk>

  > I was wondering what the copyright status of your "UK English
  > Wordlist With Frequency Classification" word list as it seems to
  > be lacking any copyright notice.

  There were many many sources in total, but any text marked
  "copyright" was avoided. Locally-written documentation was one
  source. An earlier version of the list resided in a filespace called
  PUBLIC on the University mainframe, because it was considered public
  domain.

  Date: Tue, 11 Jul 2000 19:31:34 +0100

  > So are you saying your word list is also in the public domain?

  That is the intention.

The 20 level includes frequency classes 7-15 from Brian's word list.

The 35 level includes frequency classes 2-6 and words appearing in at
least 11 of 12 dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts package.  All
words from the 12Dicts package have had likely inflections added via
my inflection database.

The 12Dicts package and Supplement is in the Public Domain.

The WordNet database, which was used in the creation of the
Inflections database, is under the following copyright:

  This software and database is being provided to you, the LICENSEE,

  and/or database.  Title to copyright in this software, database and
  any associated documentation shall at all times remain with

The 40 level includes words from Alan's 3esl list found in version 4.0
of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 3esl list is also in the
public domain.

The 50 level includes Brian's frequency class 1, words appearing
in at least 5 of 12 of the dictionaries as indicated in the 12Dicts
package, and uppercase words in at least 4 of the previous 12
dictionaries.  A decent number of proper names is also included: The
top 1000 male, female, and Last names from the 1990 Census report; a
list of names sent to me by Alan Beale; and a few names that I added
myself.  Finally a small list of abbreviations not commonly found in
other word lists is included.

The name files form the Census report is a government document which I
don't think can be copyrighted.

The file special-jargon.50 uses common.lst and word.lst from the
"Unofficial Jargon File Word Lists" which is derived from "The Jargon
File".  All of which is in the Public Domain.  This file also contain
a few extra UNIX terms which are found in the file "unix-terms" in the
special/ directory.

The 55 level includes words from Alan's 2of4brif list found in version
4.0 of his 12dicts package.  Like his other stuff the 2of4brif is also
in the public domain.

The 60 level includes all words appearing in at least 2 of the 12
dictionaries as indicated by the 12Dicts package.

The 70 level includes Brian's frequency class 0 and the 74,550 common
dictionary words from the MWords package.  The common dictionary words,
like those from the 12Dicts package, have had all likely inflections
added.  The 70 level also included the 5desk list from version 4.0 of
the 12Dics package which is in the public domain.

The 80 level includes the ENABLE word list, all the lists in the
ENABLE supplement package (except for ABLE), the "UK Advanced Cryptics
Dictionary" (UKACD), the list of signature words from the YAWL package,
and the 10,196 places list from the MWords package.

The ENABLE package, mainted by M\Cooper <thegrendel@theriver.com>,
is in the Public Domain:

  The ENABLE master word list, WORD.LST, is herewith formally released
  into the Public Domain. Anyone is free to use it or distribute it in
  any manner they see fit. No fee or registration is required for its
  use nor are "contributions" solicited (if you feel you absolutely
  must contribute something for your own peace of mind, the authors of
  the ENABLE list ask that you make a donation on their behalf to your
  favorite charity). This word list is our gift to the Scrabble
  community, as an alternate to "official" word lists. Game designers
  may feel free to incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please
  mention the source and credit us as originators of the list. Note
  that if you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product,
  you may still copyright and protect your product, but you may *not*
  legally copyright or in any way restrict redistribution of the
  WORD.LST portion of your product. This *may* under law restrict your
  rights to restrict your users' rights, but that is only fair.

UKACD, by J Ross Beresford <ross@bryson.demon.co.uk>, is under the
following copyright:

  Copyright (c) J Ross Beresford 1993-1999. All Rights Reserved.

  The following restriction is placed on the use of this publication:
  if The UK Advanced Cryptics Dictionary is used in a software package
  or redistributed in any form, the copyright notice must be
  prominently displayed and the text of this document must be included
  verbatim.

  There are no other restrictions: I would like to see the list
  distributed as widely as possible.

The 95 level includes the 354,984 single words, 256,772 compound
words, 4,946 female names and the 3,897 male names, and 21,986 names
from the MWords package, ABLE.LST from the ENABLE Supplement, and some
additional words found in my part-of-speech database that were not
found anywhere else.

Accent information was taken from UKACD.

and Australian word list.  It is under the following copyright:

Comment:
 File lacks copyright and licensing, but contains the comment
 "Conversion routines derived from code by guido@sienanet.it" which
 might be interpreted as a copyright holder not granting a license.
 More likely, however, the header file is considered non-copyrightable
 header with merely a remark about origin of inspiration:
 .
  * File was introduced in Asterisk 0.1.1 (according to git sources),
    together with file format_wav_gsm.c containing same comment but
    also explicit copyright and licensing:
    <https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/commit/0ed94773>.
 .
  * Asterisk 0.1.1 was released in 1999 (according to git sources),
    at about which time Guido Giorgetti <guido@sienanet.it> released
    audio-related Delphi 3 code as "Freeware":
    <http://delphi.icm.edu.pl/authors/a0002451.htm>
    <http://delphi.icm.edu.pl/ftp/d30free/tmsgvoc.zip>

 Thank you for your trouble. I intended the software to be free. GPL is
 fine. Please add the appropriate text to the file for me, in my name.

License: GPL-2-Asterisk
 Asterisk is distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2
 and is also available under alternative licenses negotiated directly
 with Digium, Inc. If you obtained Asterisk under the GPL, then the GPL
 applies to all loadable Asterisk modules used on your system as well,
 except as defined below. The GPL (version 2) is included in this
 source tree in the file COPYING.
 .
 This package also includes various components that are not part of
 Asterisk itself; these components are in the 'contrib' directory
 and its subdirectories. These components are also distributed under the
 GPL version 2 as well.
 .
 Digium, Inc. (formerly Linux Support Services) holds copyright
 and/or sufficient licenses to all components of the Asterisk
 package, and therefore can grant, at its sole discretion, the ability
 for companies, individuals, or organizations to create proprietary or
 Open Source (even if not GPL) modules which may be dynamically linked at
 runtime with the portions of Asterisk which fall under our
 copyright/license umbrella, or are distributed under more flexible
 licenses than GPL.
 .
 If you wish to use our code in other GPL programs, don't worry --
 there is no requirement that you provide the same exception in your
 GPL'd products (although if you've written a module for Asterisk we
 would strongly encourage you to make the same exception that we do).
 .
 Specific permission is also granted to link Asterisk with OpenSSL, OpenH323
 and/or the UW IMAP Toolkit and distribute the resulting binary files.
 .
 In addition, Asterisk implements two management/control protocols: the
 Asterisk Manager Interface (AMI) and the Asterisk Gateway Interface
 (AGI). It is our belief that applications using these protocols to
 manage or control an Asterisk instance do not have to be licensed
 under the GPL or a compatible license, as we believe these protocols
 do not create a 'derivative work' as referred to in the GPL. However,
 should any court or other judiciary body find that these protocols do
 fall under the terms of the GPL, then we hereby grant you a license to
 use these protocols in combination with Asterisk in external
 applications licensed under any license you wish.
 .
 The 'Asterisk' name and logos are trademarks owned by Digium, Inc.,
 and use of them is subject to our trademark licensing policies. If you
 wish to use these trademarks for purposes other than simple
 redistribution of Asterisk source code obtained from Digium, you
 should contact our licensing department to determine the necessary
 steps you must take. For more information on this policy, please read:

  1. Definitions
     The terms 'reproduce,' 'reproduction,' 'derivative works,' and
     'distribution' have the same meaning here as under U.S. copyright
     law.
     A 'contribution' is the original software, or any additions or
     changes to the software.
     A 'contributor' is any person that distributes its contribution
     under this license.
     'Licensed patents' are a contributor's patent claims that read
     directly on its contribution.
 .
 2. Grant of Rights
    (A) Copyright Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including
        the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each
        contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
        copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare
        derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its
        contribution or any derivative works that you create.
    (B) Patent Grant- Subject to the terms of this license, including
        the license conditions and limitations in section 3, each
        contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
        license under its licensed patents to make, have made, use,
        sell, offer for sale, import, and/or otherwise dispose of its
        contribution in the software or derivative works of the
        contribution in the software.
 .
 3. Conditions and Limitations
    (A) No Trademark License- This license does not grant you rights to
        use any contributors' name, logo, or trademarks.
    (B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents
        that you claim are infringed by the software, your patent
        license from such contributor to the software ends
        automatically.
    (C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain
        all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that
        are present in the software.
    (D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code
        form, you may do so only under this license by including a
        complete copy of this license with your distribution. If you
        distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object
        code form, you may only do so under a license that complies with
        this license.
    (E) The software is licensed "as-is." You bear the risk of using it.
        The contributors give no express warranties, guarantees or
        conditions. You may have additional consumer rights under your
        local laws which this license cannot change. To the extent
        permitted under your local laws, the contributors exclude the
        implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular
        purpose and non-infringement.

License: CC-BY-SA-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
 WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
 THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions.
 .
 a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
 anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
 unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions,
 constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
 assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
 Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined
 below) for the purposes of this License.
 .
 b. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is
 listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
 approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
 License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
 terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
 Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing
 of derivatives of works made available under that license under this
 License or either a Creative Commons unported license or a Creative
 Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this
 License.
 .
 c. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
 and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
 arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
 sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
 other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
 except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
 considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
 avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
 recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
 moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
 purpose of this License.
 .
 d. "License Elements" means the following high-level license
 attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this
 License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
 .
 e. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
 that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
 .
 f. "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or
 entities who created the Work.
 .
 g. "Work" means the copyrighted voice prompt files recorded by Allison
 Smith for Asterisk and distributed with this License.
 .
 h. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
 License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
 respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
 Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
 violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights.
 .
 Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
 rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the
 exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant.
 .
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
 grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
 the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
 rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
 Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
 Collective Works;
 .
 b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
 Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes
 reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
 that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
 translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
 English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
 work has been modified.";
 .
 c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
 publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
 transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
 .
 d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
 publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
 transmission Derivative Works.
 .
 e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
 composition:
 .
  i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
  exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the event
  that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society
  (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public
  performance or public digital performance e.g. webcast) of the Work.
 .
  ii.Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
  exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
  rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties
  for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and
  distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
  Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
  jurisdictions).
 .
 f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
 doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
 exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
 performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
 public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the
 compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright
 Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.
 .
 The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
 and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
 digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and
 You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
 this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
 distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
 perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
 restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a recipient of
 the Work to exercise of the rights granted to that recipient under the
 terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
 intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
 warranties. When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
 or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any
 technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
 recipient of the Work from You to exercise of the rights granted to
 that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
 applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
 does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be
 made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
 Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
 practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by
 Section 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon
 notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
 from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
 requested.
 .
 b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
 digitally perform a Derivative Work only under: (i) the terms of this
 License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License
 Elements as this License; (iii) either the Creative Commons (Unported)
 license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a
 later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
 License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (Unported)); (iv) a Creative
 Commons Compatible License. If you license the Derivative Work under
 one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
 of that license. If you license the Derivative Work under the terms of
 any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
 License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
 generally and with the following provisions: (I) You must include a
 copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, the Applicable
 License with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You
 distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
 perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative
 Works that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability
 of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
 recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must
 keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to
 the disclaimer of warranties; and, (IV) when You distribute, publicly
 display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You
 may not impose any technological measures on the Derivative Work that
 restrict the ability of a recipient of the Derivative Work from You to
 exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
 Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Derivative Work
 as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
 Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
 subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
 .
 c. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
 digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
 Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works
 (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been
 made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
 the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
 utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
 applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
 Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,
 publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
 Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
 means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
 supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
 Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
 Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
 licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b)
 in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the
 Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
 Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
 Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented
 in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
 Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
 appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative
 Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in
 a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
 contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
 credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
 manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
 License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
 connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
 Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
 use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
 permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
 Parties.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer.
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
 LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS
 HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO
 REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,
 EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
 TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability.
 .
 EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
 LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
 OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination.
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
 License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
 Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
 their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
 in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
 will survive any termination of this License.
 .
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
 is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
 Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
 release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing
 the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will
 not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has
 been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),
 and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
 terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous.
 .
 a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
 defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in
 Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
 the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
 You under this License.
 .
 b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
 Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
 on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
 this License.
 .
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
 by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
 the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 enforceable.
 .
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
 and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 .
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
 with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
 here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
 may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
 modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

    CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS

     including in any form recognizably derived from the original,
     except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be
     considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the
     avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance

     with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation
     for the purpose of this License.  b. "Collection" means a
     collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias
     and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
     other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section
     1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of
     their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the
     Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one
     or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into
     a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not
     be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of
     this License.  c. "Distribute" means to make available to the

     appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
     d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or

     e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
     work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
     the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the
     publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the
     actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,
     sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform
     literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
     case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
     who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
     (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits
     the broadcast.  f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work
     offered under the terms of this License including without
     limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic
     domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression
     including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
     writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
     nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work
     or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or
     without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated
     works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work
     of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
     lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
     expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
     art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
     relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
     performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to
     the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work
     performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not
     otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.  g. "You" means
     an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who
     has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect
     to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
     Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
     violation.  h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public
     recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those
     public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or
     wireless means or public digital performances; to make available
     to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may
     access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen
     by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process
     and the communication to the public of the performances of the
     Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
     rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or

    reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
    arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
    connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or
    other applicable laws.
 .
    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
    copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
    below: a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one
    or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in
    the Collections; b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided
    that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
    takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
    identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example,
    a translation could be marked "The original work was translated
    from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
    original work has been modified."; c. to Distribute and Publicly
    Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
    d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.  e. For the
    avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In
    those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
    any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
    Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for
    any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
    which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
    compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
    exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
    of the rights granted under this License; and, iii. Voluntary
    License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
    royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor
    is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary
    licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of
    the rights granted under this License.
 .
    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
    now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right
    to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise
    the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
    rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
    expressly made subject to and limited by the following
    restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
    only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of,
    or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with
    every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may
    not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms
    of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
    the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact
    all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
    warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may
    not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
    restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to
    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
    the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated
    in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
    from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor
    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any
    credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
    Section 4(b), as requested.  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly
    Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must,
    unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
    intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
    Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or
    if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
    parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such
    party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to
    the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
    Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an
    Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
    Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
    Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
    Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be
    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
    the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
    will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
    Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and
    in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
    contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use
    the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
    this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
    any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
    Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You
    or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
    written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
    Attribution Parties.  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by
    the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
    You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by
    itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not
    distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in
    relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
    Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
    jurisdictions (e.g.  Japan), in which any exercise of the right
    granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make
    Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
    Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
    LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
    WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
    STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
    OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
    NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
    ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
    DISCOVERABLE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
    LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
    OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
    WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
 .
    7. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
     will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms
     of this License.  Individuals or entities who have received
     Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however,
     will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
     or entities remain in full compliance with those
     licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
     termination of this License.  b. Subject to the above terms and
     conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
     duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
     the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
     different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any
     time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
     withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
     required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
     License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
     as stated above.
 .
    8. Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform
     the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
     license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
     license granted to You under this License.  b. Each time You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to
     the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
     under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
     enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
     without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
     provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
     make such provision valid and enforceable.  d. No term or
     provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
     consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
     signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
     parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
     understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
     Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
     additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
     You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
     agreement of the Licensor and You.  f. The rights granted under,
     and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted
     utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the
     Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September
     28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty
     of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
     the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24,
     1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
     jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
     those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
     standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
     additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
     License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights
     under applicable law.

License: CC-BY-SA-3.0
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
 WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU
 THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
 TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
 .
 1. Definitions.
 .
 a. "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue,
 anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
 unmodified form, along with one or more other contributions,
 constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
 assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
 Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as defined
 below) for the purposes of this License.
 .
 b. "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is
 listed at http://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been
 approved by Creative Commons as being essentially equivalent to this
 License, including, at a minimum, because that license: (i) contains
 terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
 Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the relicensing
 of derivatives of works made available under that license under this
 License or either a Creative Commons unported license or a Creative
 Commons jurisdiction license with the same License Elements as this
 License.
 .
 c. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work
 and other pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical
 arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion picture version,
 sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, condensation, or any
 other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted,
 except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be
 considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of this License. For the
 avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical composition or sound
 recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a
 moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the
 purpose of this License.
 .
 d. "License Elements" means the following high-level license
 attributes as selected by Licensor and indicated in the title of this
 License: Attribution, ShareAlike.
 .
 e. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
 that offers the Work under the terms of this License.
 .
 f. "Original Author" means the individual, individuals, entity or
 entities who created the Work.
 .
 g. "Work" means the copyrighted voice prompt files recorded by Allison
 Smith for Asterisk and distributed with this License.
 .
 h. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
 License who has not previously violated the terms of this License with
 respect to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
 Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
 violation.
 .
 2. Fair Use Rights.
 .
 Nothing in this license is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict any
 rights arising from fair use, first sale or other limitations on the
 exclusive rights of the copyright owner under copyright law or other
 applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant.
 .
 Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
 grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for
 the duration of the applicable copyright) license to exercise the
 rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
 a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
 Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
 Collective Works;
 .
 b. to create and reproduce Derivative Works provided that any such
 Derivative Work, including any translation in any medium, takes
 reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
 that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
 translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
 English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
 work has been modified.";
 .
 c. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
 publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
 transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective Works;
 .
 d. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly, perform
 publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
 transmission Derivative Works.
 .
 e. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
 composition:
 .
  i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor waives the
  exclusive right to collect, whether individually or, in the event
  that Licensor is a member of a performance rights society
  (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC), via that society, royalties for the public
  performance or public digital performance e.g. webcast) of the Work.
 .
  ii.Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the
  exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a music
  rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency), royalties
  for any phonorecord You create from the Work ("cover version") and
  distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC
  Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other
  jurisdictions).
 .
 f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of
 doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor waives the
 exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
 performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
 public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the
 compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright
 Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions).
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. All rights not expressly granted by
 Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions.
 .
 The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to
 and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
 a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
 digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this License, and
 You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for,
 this License with every copy or phonorecord of the Work You
 distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
 perform. You may not offer or impose any terms on the Work that
 restrict the terms of this License or the ability of a recipient of
 the Work to exercise of the rights granted to that recipient under the
 terms of the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep
 intact all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
 warranties. When You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform,
 or publicly digitally perform the Work, You may not impose any
 technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
 recipient of the Work from You to exercise of the rights granted to
 that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
 applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this
 does not require the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be
 made subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective
 Work, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
 practicable, remove from the Collective Work any credit as required by
 Section 4(c), as requested. If You create a Derivative Work, upon
 notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove
 from the Derivative Work any credit as required by Section 4(c), as
 requested.
 .
 b. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
 digitally perform a Derivative Work only under: (i) the terms of this
 License; (ii) a later version of this License with the same License
 Elements as this License; (iii) either the Creative Commons (Unported)
 license or a Creative Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a
 later license version) that contains the same License Elements as this
 License (e.g. Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 (Unported)); (iv) a Creative
 Commons Compatible License. If you license the Derivative Work under
 one of the licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms
 of that license. If you license the Derivative Work under the terms of
 any of the licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable
 License"), you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License
 generally and with the following provisions: (I) You must include a
 copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier for, the Applicable
 License with every copy or phonorecord of each Derivative Work You
 distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally
 perform; (II) You may not offer or impose any terms on the Derivative
 Works that restrict the terms of the Applicable License or the ability
 of a recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that
 recipient under the terms of the Applicable License; (III) You must
 keep intact all notices that refer to the Applicable License and to
 the disclaimer of warranties; and, (IV) when You distribute, publicly
 display, publicly perform, or publicly digitally perform the Work, You
 may not impose any technological measures on the Derivative Work that
 restrict the ability of a recipient of the Derivative Work from You to
 exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
 Applicable License. This Section 4(b) applies to the Derivative Work
 as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require the
 Collective Work apart from the Derivative Work itself to be made
 subject to the terms of the Applicable License.
 .
 c. If You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
 digitally perform the Work (as defined in Section 1 above) or any
 Derivative Works (as defined in Section 1 above) or Collective Works
 (as defined in Section 1 above), You must, unless a request has been
 made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for
 the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are
 utilizing: (i) the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if
 applicable) if supplied, and/or (ii) if the Original Author and/or
 Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g. a sponsor institute,
 publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
 Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
 means, the name of such party or parties; the title of the Work if
 supplied; to the extent reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource
 Identifier, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
 Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or
 licensing information for the Work; and, consistent with Section 3(b)
 in the case of a Derivative Work, a credit identifying the use of the
 Work in the Derivative Work (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
 Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
 Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be implemented
 in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
 Derivative Work or Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will
 appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Derivative
 Work or Collective Work appears, then as part of these credits and in
 a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
 contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the
 credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
 manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
 License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
 connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
 Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
 use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
 permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
 Parties.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer.
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
 LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT OF ANY RIGHTS
 HELD IN THE LICENSED WORK BY THE LICENSOR. THE LICENSOR MAKES NO
 REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK,
 EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT
 LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MARKETABILITY, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY
 TO YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability.
 .
 EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL
 LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL,
 INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT
 OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN
 ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination.
 .
 a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
 automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
 License. Individuals or entities who have received Derivative Works or
 Collective Works from You under this License, however, will not have
 their licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
 in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8
 will survive any termination of this License.
 .
 b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
 is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
 Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
 release the Work under different license terms or to stop distributing
 the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will
 not serve to withdraw this License (or any other license that has
 been, or is required to be, granted under the terms of this License),
 and this License will continue in full force and effect unless
 terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous.
 .
 a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the Work (as
 defined in Section 1 above) or a Collective Work (as defined in
 Section 1 above), the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to
 the Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to
 You under this License.
 .
 b. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform a Derivative
 Work, Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the original Work
 on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You under
 this License.
 .
 c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
 applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
 the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further action
 by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be reformed to
 the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and
 enforceable.
 .
 d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
 breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing
 and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
 .
 e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
 with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
 agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
 here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
 may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
 modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.

    1. Definitions a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or
     upon the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
     adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other
     alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or
     performance and includes cinematographic adaptations or any other
     form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted
     including in any form recognizably derived from the original,
     except that a work that constitutes a Collection will not be
     considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License. For the
     avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance
     or phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation
     with a moving image ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation
     for the purpose of this License.  b. "Collection" means a
     collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias
     and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or
     other works or subject matter other than works listed in Section
     1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and arrangement of
     their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the
     Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one
     or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
     independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into
     a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not
     be considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of
     this License.  c. "Distribute" means to make available to the
     public the original and copies of the Work or Adaptation, as
     appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
     d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or
     entities that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
     e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic
     work, the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created
     the Work or if no individual or entity can be identified, the
     publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the
     actors, singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act,
     sing, deliver, declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform
     literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the
     case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity
     who first fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and,
     (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits
     the broadcast.  f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work
     offered under the terms of this License including without
     limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic
     domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression
     including digital form, such as a book, pamphlet and other
     writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
     nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work
     or entertainment in dumb show; a musical composition with or
     without words; a cinematographic work to which are assimilated
     works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work
     of drawing, painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or
     lithography; a photographic work to which are assimilated works
     expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
     art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work
     relative to geography, topography, architecture or science; a
     performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation of data to
     the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work
     performed by a variety or circus performer to the extent it is not
     otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.  g. "You" means
     an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who
     has not previously violated the terms of this License with respect
     to the Work, or who has received express permission from the
     Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a previous
     violation.  h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public
     recitations of the Work and to communicate to the public those
     public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or
     wireless means or public digital performances; to make available
     to the public Works in such a way that members of the public may
     access these Works from a place and at a place individually chosen
     by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process
     and the communication to the public of the performances of the
     Work, including by public digital performance; to broadcast and
     rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or
     images.  i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any
     means including without limitation by sound or visual recordings
     and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work,
     including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in
     digital form or other electronic medium.
 .
    2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to
    reduce, limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights
    arising from limitations or exceptions that are provided for in
    connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or
    other applicable laws.
 .
    3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
    copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
    below: a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one
    or more Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in
    the Collections; b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided
    that any such Adaptation, including any translation in any medium,
    takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
    identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example,
    a translation could be marked "The original work was translated
    from English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The
    original work has been modified."; c. to Distribute and Publicly
    Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections; and,
    d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.  e. For the
    avoidance of doubt: i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In
    those jurisdictions in which the right to collect royalties through
    any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the
    Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for
    any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
    which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
    compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives the
    exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
    of the rights granted under this License; and, iii. Voluntary
    License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect
    royalties, whether individually or, in the event that the Licensor
    is a member of a collecting society that administers voluntary
    licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of
    the rights granted under this License.
 .
    The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether
    now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right
    to make such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise
    the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
    rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
    4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is
    expressly made subject to and limited by the following
    restrictions: a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work
    only under the terms of this License. You must include a copy of,
    or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with
    every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may
    not offer or impose any terms on the Work that restrict the terms
    of this License or the ability of the recipient of the Work to
    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
    the License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact
    all notices that refer to this License and to the disclaimer of
    warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may
    not impose any effective technological measures on the Work that
    restrict the ability of a recipient of the Work from You to
    exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
    the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated
    in a Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart
    from the Work itself to be made subject to the terms of this
    License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor
    You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any
    credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested. If You create an
    Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent
    practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by
    Section 4(b), as requested.  b. If You Distribute, or Publicly
    Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You must,
    unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep
    intact all copyright notices for the Work and provide, reasonable
    to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i) the name of the
    Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or
    if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or
    parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing entity, journal) for
    attribution ("Attribution Parties") in Licensor's copyright notice,
    terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of such
    party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to
    the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor
    specifies to be associated with the Work, unless such URI does not
    refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for the
    Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an
    Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the Work in the
    Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by Original
    Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
    Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be
    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in
    the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit
    will appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the
    Adaptation or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and
    in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the other
    contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use
    the credit required by this Section for the purpose of attribution
    in the manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under
    this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply
    any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original
    Author, Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You
    or Your use of the Work, without the separate, express prior
    written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
    Attribution Parties.  c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by
    the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted by applicable law, if
    You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by
    itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not
    distort, mutilate, modify or take other derogatory action in
    relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the Original
    Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those
    jurisdictions (e.g.  Japan), in which any exercise of the right
    granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the right to make
    Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation,
    modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original
    Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive or not
    assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
    5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
    UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
    LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
    WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
    STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
    OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
    NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
    ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
    DISCOVERABLE.  SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
 .
    6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
    LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
    OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
    WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
 .
    7. Termination a. This License and the rights granted hereunder
     will terminate automatically upon any breach by You of the terms
     of this License.  Individuals or entities who have received
     Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however,
     will not have their licenses terminated provided such individuals
     or entities remain in full compliance with those
     licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any
     termination of this License.  b. Subject to the above terms and
     conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for the
     duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding
     the above, Licensor reserves the right to release the Work under
     different license terms or to stop distributing the Work at any
     time; provided, however that any such election will not serve to
     withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is
     required to be, granted under the terms of this License), and this
     License will continue in full force and effect unless terminated
     as stated above.
 .
    8. Miscellaneous a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform
     the Work or a Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
     license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
     license granted to You under this License.  b. Each time You
     Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to
     the recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and
     conditions as the license granted to You under this License.
     c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
     under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
     enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
     without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
     provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
     make such provision valid and enforceable.  d. No term or
     provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach
     consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and
     signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or consent.
     e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
     parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
     understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
     Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
     additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
     You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
     agreement of the Licensor and You.  f. The rights granted under,
     and the subject matter referenced, in this License were drafted
     utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the
     Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as amended on September
     28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the WIPO Copyright Treaty
     of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and
     the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24,
     1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the relevant
     jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be enforced
     according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of
     those treaty provisions in the applicable national law. If the
     standard suite of rights granted under applicable copyright law
     includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
     additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this
     License is not intended to restrict the license of any rights
     under applicable law.

 1. Definitions
 .
  a "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
    be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
    recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
    constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
    Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
    ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
    this License.
  b "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
    as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
    License.
  c "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
    other transfer of ownership.
  d "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
    that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
  e "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and
    in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver,
    declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or
    artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a
    phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first
    fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the

  f "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the

    other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work;
    a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical

    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License

 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
  a to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
  b to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
    Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
    reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
    that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
    translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
    English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
    work has been modified.";
  c to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
    incorporated in Collections; and,
  d to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  f For the avoidance of doubt:
    i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
       in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
       compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
       reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
       exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
         the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
         any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
    terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
    ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
    to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
    this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
    the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
    that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
    not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
    subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b),
    as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
    Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
  b If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
    or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
    supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
    another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
    entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
    Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
    means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
    if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
    such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b),
    in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
    Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
    Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
    Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be
    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
    case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
    at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
    required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
  c Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
    or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
    or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
    be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
    Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
    any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
    (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
    the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
    or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
 YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
  b Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
    Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
    release the Work under different license terms or to stop
    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
    of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
    effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
    Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
    under this License.
  b Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.
  c If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
    valid and enforceable.
  d No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
    consent.
  e This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
    You.
  f The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
    Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
    WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
    Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
    July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
    relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
    enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
    law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
    copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
    License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
    License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
    rights under applicable law.

License: CC-BY-SA
 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS
 PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK
 OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
 RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS

 1. Definitions
 .
  a "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
    be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
    recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
    constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
    Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
    ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
    this License.
  b "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
    as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
    considered an Adaptation (as defined below) for the purposes of this
    License.
  c "Creative Commons Compatible License" means a license that is listed
    at https://creativecommons.org/compatiblelicenses that has been

    terms that have the same purpose, meaning and effect as the License
    Elements of this License; and, (ii) explicitly permits the
    relicensing of adaptations of works made available under that
    license under this License or a Creative Commons jurisdiction
    license with the same License Elements as this License.
  d "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or

    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver,
    declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or
    artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a
    phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first
    fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the
    case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
  h "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
    terms of this License including without limitation any production in
    the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the
    mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a

    other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work;
    a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which
    are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
    cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
    sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
    are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
    photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,
    sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
    architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
    compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
    work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the
    extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
  i "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
    with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
    from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
    previous violation.
  j "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
    and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
    means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
    digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
    a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place

    the public by any means or process and the communication to the

    performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means
    including signs, sounds or images.
  k "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including

 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
  a to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
  b to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
    Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
    reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
    that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
    translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
    English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
    work has been modified.";
  c to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
    incorporated in Collections; and,
  d to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  e For the avoidance of doubt:
    i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
       in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
       compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
       reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
       exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
         the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
         any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
    terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
    ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
    to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
    this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
    the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
    that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
    not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
    subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c),
    as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
    Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
  b You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
    terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License
    with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative
    Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
    version) that contains the same License Elements as this License
    (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
    Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the
    licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
    license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the
    licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
    you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally
    and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the
    URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation
    You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose
    any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the
    Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
    to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
    the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability
    of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights
    granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
    This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
    Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the
    Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
    License.
  c If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
    or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
    supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
    another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
    entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
    Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
    means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
    if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
    such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
    in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
    Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
    Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
    Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
    case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
    at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
    required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
  d Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
    or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
    or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
    be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
    Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
    any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
    (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
    the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
    or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
 YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
  b Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
    Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
    release the Work under different license terms or to stop
    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
    of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
    effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
    Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
    under this License.
  b Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.
  c If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
    valid and enforceable.
  d No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
    consent.
  e This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
    You.
  f The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
    Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
    WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
    Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
    July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
    relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
    enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
    law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
    copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
    License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
    License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
    rights under applicable law.

 THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
 CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS

 OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
 PROHIBITED.
 .
 BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND
 AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS
 LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE
 RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS

 1. Definitions
 .
  a "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and
    other pre-existing works, such as a translation, adaptation,
    derivative work, arrangement of music or other alterations of a
    literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
    cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may
    be recast, transformed, or adapted including in any form
    recognizably derived from the original, except that a work that
    constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for
    the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
    Work is a musical work, performance or phonogram, the
    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
    ("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of
    this License.
  b "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such
    as encyclopedias and anthologies, or performances, phonograms or
    broadcasts, or other works or subject matter other than works listed
    in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
    arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in
    which the Work is included in its entirety in unmodified form along
    with one or more other contributions, each constituting separate and
    independent works in themselves, which together are assembled into a
    collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
    considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this
    License.
  c "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and
    copies of the Work or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or
    other transfer of ownership.
  d "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities
    that offer(s) the Work under the terms of this License.
  e "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work,
    the individual, individuals, entity or entities who created the Work
    or if no individual or entity can be identified, the publisher; and
    in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors, singers,
    musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver,
    declaim, play in, interpret or otherwise perform literary or
    artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii) in the case of a
    phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first
    fixes the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the
    case of broadcasts, the organization that transmits the broadcast.
  f "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the
    terms of this License including without limitation any production in
    the literary, scientific and artistic domain, whatever may be the
    mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as a
    book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or
    other work of the same nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work;
    a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb show; a musical
    composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which
    are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
    cinematography; a work of drawing, painting, architecture,
    sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
    are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to
    photography; a work of applied art; an illustration, map, plan,
    sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography, topography,
    architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a
    compilation of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable
    work; or a work performed by a variety or circus performer to the
    extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or artistic work.
  g "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this
    License who has not previously violated the terms of this License
    with respect to the Work, or who has received express permission
    from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
    previous violation.
  h "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work
    and to communicate to the public those public recitations, by any
    means or process, including by wire or wireless means or public
    digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such
    a way that members of the public may access these Works from a place
    and at a place individually chosen by them; to perform the Work to
    the public by any means or process and the communication to the
    public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital
    performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means
    including signs, sounds or images.
  i "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including
    without limitation by sound or visual recordings and the right of
    fixation and reproducing fixations of the Work, including storage of
    a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other
    electronic medium.
 .
 2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce,
 limit, or restrict any uses free from copyright or rights arising from
 limitations or exceptions that are provided for in connection with the
 copyright protection under copyright law or other applicable laws.
 .
 3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License,
 Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive,
 perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright) license to
 exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
 .
  a to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more
    Collections, and to Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the
    Collections;
  b to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such
    Adaptation, including any translation in any medium, takes
    reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise identify
    that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a
    translation could be marked "The original work was translated from
    English to Spanish," or a modification could indicate "The original
    work has been modified.";
  c to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as
    incorporated in Collections; and,
  d to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
  f For the avoidance of doubt:
    i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
       in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
       compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
       reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
       exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
         the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
         any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
    made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
    terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
    ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
    to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
    this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
    the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
    that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
    not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
    subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(b),
    as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
    Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b), as requested.
  b If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
    or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
    supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
    another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
    entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
    Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
    means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
    if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
    such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b),
    in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
    Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
    Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
    Author"). The credit required by this Section 4 (b) may be
    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
    case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
    at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
    required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
  c Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
    or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
    or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
    be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
    Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
    any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
    (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
    the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
    or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
 YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
  b Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
    Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
    release the Work under different license terms or to stop
    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
    of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
    effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
    Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
    under this License.
  b Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.
  c If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
    valid and enforceable.
  d No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
    consent.
  e This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
    You.
  f The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
    Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
    WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
    Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
    July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
    relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
    enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
    law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
    copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
    License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
    License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
    rights under applicable law.

  e For the avoidance of doubt:
    i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions
       in which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
       compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived, the Licensor
       reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any
       exercise by You of the rights granted under this License;
    ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in
        which the right to collect royalties through any statutory or
        compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the Licensor waives
        the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise
        by You of the rights granted under this License; and,
    iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to
         collect royalties, whether individually or, in the event that
         the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
         administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from
         any exercise by You of the rights granted under this License.
 .
 The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now
 known or hereafter devised. The above rights include the right to make
 such modifications as are technically necessary to exercise the rights
 in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all rights not
 expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
 .
 4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly
 made subject to and limited by the following restrictions:
 .
  a You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms
    of this License. You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier (URI) for, this License with every copy of the Work You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
    terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the
    ability of the recipient of the Work to exercise the rights granted
    to that recipient under the terms of the License. You may not
    sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
    this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of
    the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or
    Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a
    recipient of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to
    that recipient under the terms of the License. This Section 4(a)
    applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but this does
    not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made
    subject to the terms of this License. If You create a Collection,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section 4(c),
    as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any
    Licensor You must, to the extent practicable, remove from the
    Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(c), as requested.
  b You may Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation only under the
    terms of: (i) this License; (ii) a later version of this License
    with the same License Elements as this License; (iii) a Creative
    Commons jurisdiction license (either this or a later license
    version) that contains the same License Elements as this License
    (e.g., Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 US)); (iv) a Creative Commons
    Compatible License. If you license the Adaptation under one of the
    licenses mentioned in (iv), you must comply with the terms of that
    license. If you license the Adaptation under the terms of any of the
    licenses mentioned in (i), (ii) or (iii) (the "Applicable License"),
    you must comply with the terms of the Applicable License generally
    and the following provisions: (I) You must include a copy of, or the
    URI for, the Applicable License with every copy of each Adaptation
    You Distribute or Publicly Perform; (II) You may not offer or impose
    any terms on the Adaptation that restrict the terms of the
    Applicable License or the ability of the recipient of the Adaptation
    to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
    the Applicable License; (III) You must keep intact all notices that
    refer to the Applicable License and to the disclaimer of warranties
    with every copy of the Work as included in the Adaptation You
    Distribute or Publicly Perform; (IV) when You Distribute or Publicly
    Perform the Adaptation, You may not impose any effective
    technological measures on the Adaptation that restrict the ability
    of a recipient of the Adaptation from You to exercise the rights
    granted to that recipient under the terms of the Applicable License.
    This Section 4(b) applies to the Adaptation as incorporated in a
    Collection, but this does not require the Collection apart from the
    Adaptation itself to be made subject to the terms of the Applicable
    License.
  c If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations
    or Collections, You must, unless a request has been made pursuant to
    Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright notices for the Work and
    provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
    the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if
    supplied, and/or if the Original Author and/or Licensor designate
    another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor institute, publishing
    entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
    Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable
    means, the name of such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work
    if supplied; (iii) to the extent reasonably practicable, the URI, if
    any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
    such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
    information for the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Ssection 3(b),
    in the case of an Adaptation, a credit identifying the use of the
    Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
    Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original
    Author"). The credit required by this Section 4(c) may be
    implemented in any reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the
    case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
    appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation
    or Collection appears, then as part of these credits and in a manner
    at least as prominent as the credits for the other contributing
    authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
    required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the
    manner set out above and, by exercising Your rights under this
    License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or imply any
    connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author,
    Licensor and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your
    use of the Work, without the separate, express prior written
    permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or Attribution
    Parties.
  d Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be
    otherwise permitted by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute
    or Publicly Perform the Work either by itself or as part of any
    Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
    or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would
    be prejudicial to the Original Author's honor or reputation.
    Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g. Japan), in which
    any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License
    (the right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion,
    mutilation, modification or other derogatory action prejudicial to
    the Original Author's honor and reputation, the Licensor will waive
    or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
    permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to
    reasonably exercise Your right under Section 3(b) of this License
    (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
 .
 5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
 .
 UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR
 OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY
 KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE,
 INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY,
 FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
 LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF
 ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW
 THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO
 YOU.
 .
 6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE
 LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR
 ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES
 ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR
 HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
 .
 7. Termination
 .
  a This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this License.
    Individuals or entities who have received Adaptations or Collections
    from You under this License, however, will not have their licenses
    terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full
    compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will
    survive any termination of this License.
  b Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here
    is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in the
    Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right to
    release the Work under different license terms or to stop
    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the terms
    of this License), and this License will continue in full force and
    effect unless terminated as stated above.
 .
 8. Miscellaneous
 .
  a Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a
    Collection, the Licensor offers to the recipient a license to the
    Work on the same terms and conditions as the license granted to You
    under this License.
  b Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor
    offers to the recipient a license to the original Work on the same
    terms and conditions as the license granted to You under this
    License.
  c If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under
    applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or enforceability
    of the remainder of the terms of this License, and without further
    action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall be
    reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision
    valid and enforceable.
  d No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no
    breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be in
    writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver or
    consent.
  e This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties
    with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no understandings,
    agreements or representations with respect to the Work not specified
    here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions that
    may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be
    modified without the mutual written agreement of the Licensor and
    You.
  f The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this
    License were drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne
    Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (as
    amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
    WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms
    Treaty of 1996 and the Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on
    July 24, 1971). These rights and subject matter take effect in the
    relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
    enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the
    implementation of those treaty provisions in the applicable national
    law. If the standard suite of rights granted under applicable
    copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this
    License, such additional rights are deemed to be included in the
    License; this License is not intended to restrict the license of any
    rights under applicable law.
